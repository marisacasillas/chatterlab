### Hiring now: Lab manager

The University of Chicago chatter lab seeks a technically skilled and enthusiastic lab manager to help conduct research on language processing and language learning in natural conversational contexts. Our lab conducts observational and experiment-based studies of language behavior in adults and children across multiple cultural and linguistic settings. The use of open source tools for the annotation and automated analysis of audio, image, and eye-tracking data is a key component of our work. The lab manager is responsible for a range of tasks that aid in the smooth production of high quality research (see Responsibilities below). In collaboration with PI Casillas, the lab manager will also be able to lead their own research studies, give scientific presentations, and contribute to publications. This position is a great fit for those looking to pursue a PhD in linguistics, psycholinguistics, developmental psychology, or related field, particularly those with good foundational scripting skills who want to deepen their expertise. The initial appointment is for one year, with the possibility to extend depending on performance and mutual suitability.

The Chatter Lab is founded on the principle that diversity in everyday language use is key to the study of human language cognition. We welcome opportunities to work with scholars from all walks of life, and particularly encourage those coming from marginalized groups to reach out if interested in working with us.
