### Hiring now: Lab manager

### PhD students

If you are interested in applying for a PhD in Comparative Human Development to work with Dr. Casillas, please get in touch with her. Include a CV and a brief description of what your mutual interests are and what you would like to know more about regarding the program and work in the lab.

### Interns and reesarch assistantships

The chatter lab offers a small number of paid internships for undergraduate students who want to get short-term (3 month) hands-on experience with an existing lab project. Internships are not renewable and will conclude with a short report.

We also offer a small number of research assistantships for longer time periods (i.e., 6 months and longer). Research assistants will be assigned to more in-depth tasks for existing lab projects, with tasks matched as much as possible by the student's research interest. These positions are renewable.

If you are interested in joining as an intern or research assistant, please contact Dr. Casillas with information about your major, your interests in lab research, your availability, what type of position you'd be interested in, and any questions you might have about the lab.

The chatter lab is founded on the principle that diversity in everyday language use is key to the study of human language cognition. We welcome opportunities to work with scholars from all walks of life, and particularly encourage those coming from marginalized groups to reach out if interested in working with the lab.

Our lab at the University of Chicago is located on the traditional homelands of the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi nations.
