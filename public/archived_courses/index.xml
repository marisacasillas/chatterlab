      <description>Grading guidelines: Active attendance The Spring 2020 quarter gives us 16 class sessions together (Tuesdays and Thursdays for eight weeks). Students receive 1 point for each time they actively attend a class.
What is active attendance? I will ask myself the following questions after each class session. If the answers are &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; to all three, the student receives 1 point. Otherwise they receive 0 points.

      <description>Grading guidelines: Presentation of mini study of conversation clips This assignment gives you the opportunity to present the findings of your additional annotation analysis to your fellow classmates. Your presentation should be a short video submitted at the start of class.
Full credit (4 points) for the presentation will be given when all of the following criteria are met:
the video is between 2 and 3 minutes long (maximum!) the video is submitted no later than the start of class on the day it&amp;rsquo;s due why and how the annotations were added is clearly explained, with reference to class material as appropriate the findings are clearly presented, with reference to class material as appropriate at least one weakness and one strength or one follow-up of the mini study are pointed out Presenting all this information in three minutes or less will be challenging; procrastination is not advised!</description>

      <description>Grading guidelines: Proposal for mini study of conversation clips Before adding the annotation of their choice to the conversation clips, students should first give a brief description of what they want to add and why. This proposal for additional annotation should be 300–500 words.
Full credit for the proposal (3 points) will be given when:
the proposal is 300–500 words the new annotations proposed are clearly defined a specific research question is asked it is clear how the new annotations can help answer the specific research question at least one forseeable issue or question relating to the proposed analysis is raised This proposal will be used as the basis for a one-on-one chat with Marisa about your mini study later in the week, so please turn them in by the beginning of class on May 12th.</description>

      <description>Grading guidelines: Research proposal The research proposal makes up 12% of your overall grade. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that either link to their other areas of expertise or their favorite topics introduced during the course. Marisa will grade each one with the following questions in mind:
Is the research question clear, specific, and answerable? Is the research question novel and/or creative in some way? Does the proposed method of study and the proposed analysis give a targeted answer to the research question?</description>

      <description>Grading guidelines: Research proposal sub-part submissions A significant component of this course is the development of a proposal for research. In order to prevent last-minute preparation of this time-consuming task, drafts for three subsections of the proposal will be due in advance of the final deadline (1 point each), as follows:
Outline of the proposal For full credit (1 point), students should submit an outline containing the following sections with a list of notes and/or bulleted sub-topics beneath each one:</description>

This is a groupwork project, but group members will have an opportunity to report on individual contributions. There are three primary components to each presentation:
Give a 20-minute pre-recorded mini lecture that introduces a method and gives some sort of demonstration of how the method is implemented and how it appears to participants.</description>

You&amp;rsquo;re welcome to look up other sources, but you should always cite anything you use (even readings from our course).

      <description>Grading guidelines: Squibs Over the quarter, graduate students are expected to produce six very brief (~1500–2500 word) papers on the topic of their choice related to course content. These &amp;ldquo;squibs&amp;rdquo; are used to engage further with ideas from the readings and, hopefully, to develop new ideas that can feed into the graduate student&amp;rsquo;s core work.**
What is a squib? Squibs are personal to your research interests—they are here for you to make concrete connections with what we are discussing in class and what you are thinking about in your Masters/PhD work.</description>
