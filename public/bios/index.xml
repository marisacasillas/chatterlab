      <description>Isabella Di Giovanni (she/her) About me I am a second year PhD student in the Department of Comparative Human Development at the University of Chicago. I received my BA from Cornell University, where I studied Linguistics and Psychology with a minor in Cognitive Science. As an undergrad I worked with Professor Michael Goldstein and was involved in multiple research projects exploring early language learning in social contexts. Broadly, I am interested in language acquisition and development in social contexts, and in cross-linguistic and cross-cultural comparison.</description>

      <description>Kennedy Casey (she/her/hers) About me I am the current lab manager. I joined the chatter lab in summer 2021 after completing my BA degree at Princeton University, where I concentrated in Psychology and also studied Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Neuroscience. During undergrad, I worked primarily with Dr. Casey Lew-Williams, and my thesis research combined eye-tracking and corpus-based observational methods to investigate how infants learn and represent some of their earliest words.</description>

      <description>Lizzie Mickiewicz (she/her/hers) About me I am a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in psychology and neuroscience at the University of Chicago. I am interested in exploring how cognitive processes influence language and vice versa. Specifically, I am fascinated by the idea of music as a language and means of communication, and I would like to study music medicine in the future.

About Broadly speaking, I am interested in exploring how cognitive and social processes shape the ways in which we learn, perceive, and produce language. My primary research examines the relationship between communicative skills and linguistic processing in children and adults. I use a combination of experimental- and observation-based methods to comparatively investigate these processes in both urban, Western contexts and rural, Indigenous contexts.</description>

      <description>Ruby Swensen Hi! My name is Ruby Swensen. I am in my second year as an undergraduate student studying linguistics with an emphasis in American Sign Language and a special interest in comparative human development. I joined the Chatter Lab in January 2023 excited to learn more about the many applications of language on human interaction and behavior. When I’m not studying or working in the lab, I love to go ice skating on the midway!</description>
