# The development of communicative competence

Spring 2020: CHDV 38950, LING 38951, PSYC 38960, EDSO 38950

Tuesdays and Thursdays 15.30-16.50 Chicago time

Office hours: Wednesday and Friday 8:00am–11:00am Chicago time, or by appointment.

NOTE: This course is taking place **remotely**; email the instructor if you need access to the relevant meeting and coursework links.

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

This course examines the emergence of communicative skills in humans. We will discuss the proposed cognitive, developmental, and evolutionary roots of communicative behaviors, with a focus on current gaps in our knowledge and possible pathways forward. The course will consider these issues from multiple perspectives including linguistics, psychology, and linguistic anthropology, and will cover a wide range of methods used to analyze communicative cognition.It is expected that, by the end of the course, students will able to think and write critically about how human communication and human language are intertwined in both adults and children.

**Course materials:**

All course materials, including readings, grading rubrics, lecture materials, and more will be available online on Canvas and the ChatterLab [webpage](https://marisacasillas.github.io/chatterlab/Casillas-DevCommComp-Spring2020-Syllabus.html) for this course.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:

### Reading notes (30%)

Students are expected to submit digital notes summarizing and reacting to each assigned reading (~1/2 page+ each; see the Schedule). Marisa will evaluate each student's notes for each reading on a pass/fail basis: tips for effective note-taking will be covered in the first class. There are a total of 36 required readings, but notes are only required for 30 of them, and students may pick which 30 readings to submit notes for (i.e., students earn 1% for each reading with satisfactory notes). Explanation video [here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/wup3crHV2ThLGM_10Fn5VqcaIa27X6a8hiRK_qIMz0yW9AJoYHNZscien6trSQ-V).

* 30 x 1 point for every [reading with notes](./course_instructions/instructions-reading_notes.md)

### Transcription mini-project (20%)

Students will incrementally add annotations to a small collection of interaction clips over multiple weeks (a brief intro video [here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/yv14Hr37z2FOQ7fk7B_PWb4qPKbZX6a8hCMc_fAEyNf02JF_ZVsfWgQSoRqm3O8)). Each time they submit new annotations, they are expected to submit short written reflections on their progress (200–500 words). The submission of annotations and reflections takes place four times (up to 3% for all four submissions). Students will also propose a mini research question that can be addressed by additional annotations of the data (up to 3%) and after executing these additional annotations, will present their findings to the class (up to 4%). Students are be expected to provide useful feedback about each other's presentations (1%; see a brief introduction video [here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/6OdQcOjf-jhLeZXU0lr8UYQdL67CX6a803Md_vRYykrnEVx3MjVH7zXJ1kDeQWc1)).

* 4 x 3 points for every [annotation + reflections submission](./course_instructions/instructions-annotation_reflections.md), tutorials for [diarization](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/play/6MYrJrqtrzs3GIfGuASDB_ArW420e6us0SNI_aYLxE-2BXAHZgGvN-MSYOLky5xQemWT1_zVnTjxvsza) and [transcription](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/play/u8Z-Ib2qrW83GNPEtASDA_ErW9TpKa-s1yYcqfEKmkm8B3EAYVP1ZeESauDKs7z6rz0irBlBdEr83F1H) are available at the linked locations, but please ask if you have any questions!
* 1 x 3 points for [proposal of mini research question](./course_instructions/instructions-annotation_proposal.md)
* 1 x 4 points for [presentation of findings](./course_instructions/instructions-annotation_presentation.md)
* 1 x 1 point for [peer-grading of presentations](./course_instructions/instructions-annotation_peer_grading.md)

### Open research proposal (15%)

Students will propose a research project relevant to topics covered in class; proposals can be in the form of follow-up studies or a new line of research (10–15 single-spaced pages). To ensure timely completion of the proposal, initial drafts of its subparts will be due over the course of the last few weeks (1% each for an outline, basic design, and literature review). The final proposal will be evaluated by Marisa (up to 12%).

* 3 x 1 point for every [proposal sub-part submission](./course_instructions/instructions-research_proposal_subparts.md)
* 1 x 12 points for [proposal of research project](./course_instructions/instructions-research_proposal.md)

### Participation (20%)

This is a discussion-based class and students are generally expected to come to class and actively participate in discussion. That said, the unpredictability and multi-timezone nature of coursework this quarter may make it difficult for students to attend some classes. The policy for attendance this quarter (Spring 2020) is therefore as follows: By default, students are expected to attend class, ask at least one question, and respond to at least one question (1% per class). If the student cannot make it to class, they should contact Marisa with a brief explanation, watch the recording of the class, and submit their question(s) and response(s) to her within 2 days, unless noted otherwise.

Two further activities are required for full participation: (a) contributions to class debates (up to 1% each) and (b) one-on-one meetings with Marisa as noted in the schedule (0.5% each)

* 16 x 1 point for [active attendance at each class](./course_instructions/instructions-active_attendance.md)
* 2 x 1 point for [contributions to the debate and the turn-taking "feature" presentation](./course_instructions/instructions-debate_participation.md)
* 4 x 0.5 point for each one-on-one meeting with Marisa, as noted in the schedule

### Final exam (15%)

Students will give two responses to take-home essay questions (up to 7% each) and will give one written reflection on the course as a whole (up to 1%). These responses can take the form of text, audio, or video, and will be graded following a rubric discussed prior to the exam.

* 2 x 7 points for each essay response (grading guidelines TBA)
* 1 x 1 point for the course reflection (grading guidelines TBA)

- After every class: Canvas announcement with summary of topics covered, readings and assignments due by next meetings, enriched with links to further instructions
