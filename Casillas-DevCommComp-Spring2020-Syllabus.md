# The development of communicative competence

Spring 2020, CHD 38950, LING 38951, PSYC 38960

Tuesdays and Thursdays 15.30-16.50, location TBA

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

This course examines the emergence of communicative skills in humans. We will discuss the proposed cognitive, developmental, and evolutionary roots of communicative behaviors, with a focus on current gaps in our knowledge and possible pathways forward. The course will consider these issues from multiple perspectives including linguistics, psychology, and linguistic anthropology, and will cover a wide range of methods used to analyze communicative cognition.It is expected that, by the end of the course, students will able to think and write critically about how human communication and human language are intertwined in both adults and children.

**Course materials:**

All course materials, including readings, grading rubrics, lecture materials, and more will be available online at: **TBA**

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:

1. **Participation (35%):** With the exception of the first lecture, students are expected to come to class with 0.5–2 pages of notes summarizing and reacting to each assigned reading. Tips for effective note-taking will be covered in the first class.
2. **Transcription (20%):** Students will incrementally add annotations to a small collection of interaction clips over the first weeks of the course. Along the way, they will submit short written reflections on their progress. They will briefly present how behaviors in their clips relate to course topics we have covered. Presentations will be peer-graded in addition to instructor grading, following a rubric discussed prior to presentations.
3. **Research proposal (20%):** Students will propose a research project relevant to topics covered in class; proposals can be in the form of follow-up studies or a new line of research. Proposals will be presented as research posters and will be peer-graded in addition to instructor grading, following a rubric discussed prior to presentations.
4. **Final exam (25%):** Students will complete two take-home essays. Essays will be graded following a rubric discussed prior to the exam.
