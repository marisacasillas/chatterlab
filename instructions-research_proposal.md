# Grading guidelines: Research proposal

The research proposal makes up 12% of your overall grade. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that either link to their other areas of expertise or their favorite topics introduced during the course. Marisa will grade each one with the following questions in mind:

1. Is the research question clear, specific, and answerable?
2. Is the research question novel and/or creative in some way?
3. Does the proposed method of study and analysis give a targeted answer to the research question?
4. Does the literature review support the relevance of the research question and/or the methods and analysis proposed?
5. Consider how specific the results would be to a single context/population would the results be: Is that specificity appropriate to the scope of the research question?
6. Is the discussion of the "if so..." scenario thorough and made with respect to the scope of the literature review and research question?
7. Is the discussion of the "if not..." scenario thorough and made with respect to the scope of the literature review and research question?
8. Does the proposal demonstrate thoughtful integration of course concepts and the student's own ideas?
9. Is the proposal well written and easy to understand with few typos?
10. Are there at least 5 research papers cited?

Marisa will assess each of these questions with the following scale and add comments for each:

```No (0) — Somewhat (1) — Partly (2) — Strongly (3)```

These assessments will be used in addition to the minimal criteria (below) to assess the final score. Proposals that strongly fulfill most/all of the questions above will be highly rated.

## All proposals must fulfill three minimal criteria:
- Be submitted on time: end of day on June 4th.
- Be between 10 and 15 pages long (single-spaced, one-inch margins, 12pt arial font)

    1. Literature review
    2. Research question
    3. Predictions
    4. Methods
    5. Analysis
    6. "If so..." discussion
    7. "If not..." discussion
    8. References cited
