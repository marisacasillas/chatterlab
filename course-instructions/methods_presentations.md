# Grading guidelines: Methods presentations

Each student is expected to participate in two methods presentations. Students earn up to 10 points (10% of the total grade) for each one.

This is a groupwork project, but group members will have an opportunity to report on individual contributions. There are three primary components to each presentation:

1. Give a 20-minute **pre-recorded** mini lecture that introduces a method and gives some sort of demonstration of how the method is implemented and how it appears to participants.
2. Elicit and answer questions from the class about the method (~10-15 minutes). You are encouraged to use creative techniques to stimulate discussion.
3. Fill out a peer evaluation form for yourself and your group members.

In preparing the presentation, each group will be asked to inteview at least one researcher who has expertise in that method. Each group must provide some media files (photo, video, audio) to support their demonstration, and should additionally provide some kind of explanation of how the analysis is done following data collection.

Marisa will assign students to methods topics at the start of the quarter. Deadlines for each methods presentation are pre-set for the quarter: students will receive the two deadlines for their methods presentations with their topic assignments.

## Expectations for full credit

### Undergraduate students

In order to earn full credit, all of the following must hold:

* The student contributed one question toward the interview with the expert researcher
* The student created at least one content slide in the mini lecture
* The student presented at least one content slide in the mini lecture
* The student's contribution to the presentation included introducing and/or explaining an important concept for the method
* The student did something to facilitate discussion or to answer questions during the live question round
* The student completed the peer evaluation form
* The student was evaluated by their group members as having made a substantial contribution

### Graduate students

Graduate students are expected to take a leadership role in their groups. In order to earn full credit, all of the following must hold:

* The student made direct email contact with the expert researcher
* The student collected questions from group members in preparation for the expert researcher interview
* The student led the group interview of the expert researcher
* The student contributed one question toward the interview with the expert researcher
* The student coordinated creation of the group presentation and Q&A activity (i.e., planning, distributing tasks, etc.)
* The student completed the peer evaluation form
* The student was evaluated by group members peers as having made a substantial contribution

## Negotiating participation and deadlines
Groupwork is complicated even when there's not a global pandemic going on! Methods presentations are planned for specific dates throughout the quarter and the deadline for each group is pre-set. **However**, if someone in your group needs special accommodations or if it becomes clear that total coordination is impossible (e.g., illness, extreme time zone differences among group members, etc.), please get in touch with Marisa right away to renegotiate participation for the presentation.
