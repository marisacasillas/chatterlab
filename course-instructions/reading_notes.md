# Grading guidelines: Reading notes

This course has a total of 36 required readings, but notes are only required for 30 of them (for undergraduate students) or for 20 of them (for graduate students). Students are allowed to pick which readings they want to submit notes for. Each reading notes submission is worth 1 point (maximum 20/30 pts for grads/undergrads, respectively). Of course students are welcome to take notes on all 36 readings, if desired.

Notes for required readings are due by the start of class. **Please have your notes accessible during class.**

## Why?
Don't notes seem a little... basic? Note taking is a fundamental  scholarly skill—one that I'm sure many of you have already practiced for years. Here are some reasons why we focus on note-taking as part of this course:

* Research on note-taking strongly suggests that it supports deep (and efficient!) learning.
* Good note-taking skills are essential for many careers, not just academic ones.
* As with most things, your ability to efficiently take high quality notes in a style that works for you can only be acquired through lots of practice.
* For remote classrooms, note-taking assignments are also a useful tool for supporting self-directed teaching and review.
* Your notes give me an opportunity to assess how well you're digesting the readings and other course content.

## How will notes be evaluated?
For full credit (1 point) the notes for each reading must:

1. Have a clear title with bibliographic information and date
2. Fill at least one half page
3. Contain sketches/simplified re-drawings of at least one key figure/finding/idea
4. Be spatially separated into at least three sections: e.g., detailed notes, overall summary, comments/questions
5. Have few direct quotes or close paraphrasings; **you should reformulate thoughts in your own words**
6. Mention at least one link to another paper covered in class or the your own research interests

- Notes can be made in the language of your choice, but please make sure I can use Google Translate or similar to assess points 4–6 above
- Notes can be written in a text editor, by hand (submitted as a high-resolution image), or a blend of the two.
- If you already have a technique for making notes, please contact me to discuss!

## Late reading notes?
Late notes can be submitted within a week of the original due date with a 0.5 point penalty.
