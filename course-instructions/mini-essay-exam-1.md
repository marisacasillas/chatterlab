# Mini essay exam 1

Please use information from the readings, lectures, and in-class sessions to inform your answers. You're welcome to look up other sources, but you should **always** cite anything you use (even readings from our course). Be careful about re-using phrasings and concepts from out-of-class sources; there's lots of information out there and not all of it is accurate. Your source citations do not count toward your maximum word count.
