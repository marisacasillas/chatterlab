# Mini essay exam 2

Please use information from the readings, lectures, and in-class sessions to inform your answers. You're welcome to look up other sources, but you should **always** cite anything you use (even readings from our course). Be careful about re-using phrasings and concepts from out-of-class sources; there's lots of information out there and not all of it is accurate. Your source citations do not count toward your maximum word count.

## Writing a grant to study the noun bias (500–750 words)

_Imagine that you are writing to the university to secure funding so that you can conduct an study on word learning. Your application will be reviewed by three faculty in the social sciences, but you don't know who. Explain the following: (a) what is the noun bias?, (b) what evidence exists for the noun bias?, (c) what are the reasons given to explain the noun bias, (d) where does the noun bias idea fall short (i.e., what **doesn't** it account for)? Then, (e), give a brief description of the study you are proposing. Your study should be designed to shed new light on the noun bias. It should be clear how your study relates to current shortcomings in the theory/data (i.e., (d) above). You can think of any study you want, including bringing kids into the lab to run experiments, giving parents questionnaires, making recordings of natural interaction, testing different populations than we have seen in class, some combination of these things—you name it! Feel free to get creative. Just make sure that your study somehow addresses a critical shortcoming in the noun bias literature, as we have covered it in class._


## Concrete examples of biases in word learning (500–750 words)

_In the paper by Braginsky et al. we saw that there were some cross-linguistically consistent patterns in word learning. Your task in this second half of the exam is to find concrete examples of these patterns. As we discussed in class, Braginsky et al. find a few strong effects:_

* _Frequent words are produced and understood earlier than infrequent words_
* _Concrete words are produced and understood earlier than non-concrete words_
* _Shorter words are produced earlier than longer words_
* _"Baby"-associated words are understood earlier than non-baby-associated words_

_Come up with two examples of each word type (frequent, infrequent, concrete, non-concrete, shorter, longer, baby-associated, non-baby-associated), that is **16 words in total**. Pick your words from the list of words available under the "Meaning" dropdown menu on [this page](http://wordbank.stanford.edu/analyses?name=uni_lemmas) and make sure that each word has data for both "Produces" and "Understands". You can check this by toggling the options in the "Measure" dropdown menu for each word. Once you have chosen your 16 words, download both the "Produces" and the "Understands" image for each one by using the "Download Plot" button at the bottom of the page. Now you should have 16 images, each of which shows word learning trajectories across some subset of the languages in Wordbank._

_Please then: (a) how you operationalized** frequent/infrequent, concrete/non-concrete, etc., when choosing your 16 words and (b) for each of the four findings listed in the bullet points above, report on the extent to which your example words are consistent with Braginsky et al.'s findings. Discuss why you think your examples might be consistent/inconsistent with the prior findings. Please paste all of your 16 images into the document so that you can refer to them when analyzing your findings in (b)._

** Operationalize here means something like "strictly define for current purposes".
