# Grading guidelines: Mini essay exams

Three times throughout the quarter, undergraduate students will be expected to complete a mini essay exam. Each mini essay exam requires students to give ~500 word responses to two prompts. The exams are take-home and open-book; students have one week to complete each exam. Each exam is worth a total of 10 points (10% of the total grade) as follows:

**Mini essay exam 1:**

* Response 1 (5 points max)

* Response 2 (5 points max)

**Mini essay exam 2:**

* Response 1 (5 points max)

* Response 2 (5 points max)

**Mini essay exam 3:**

* Response 1 (5 points max)

* Response 2 (5 points max)

## Grading

A top-scoring response will:

- Use clear and persuasive argumentation with at least two specific examples elaborated to support the arguments made,
- Draw independent and original conclusions synthesizing the relevant course content and class discussions, and
- Be typo-free and easy to understand.


## Late response submission?
Exam responses can be submitted within a week of the original due date with a 1 point penalty per late response.
