# Grading guidelines: Mini essay exams

Three times throughout the quarter, undergraduate students will be expected to complete a mini essay exam. Each mini essay exam requires students to give ~500 word responses to two prompts. The exams are take-home and open-book; students have one week to complete each exam. Each exam is worth a total of 10 points (10% of the total grade) with each question worth 5 points (5% of the total grade).


## Grading

A top-scoring response will:

- Thoroughly and accurately cover the relevant literature that we have reviewed in the course (minimally three studies),
- Use clear and persuasive argumentation with at least two specific examples to support the arguments made,
- Draw independent and original conclusions synthesizing the relevant course content and class discussions, and
- Be typo-free and easy to understand.


## Late exam submission?
Exam responses can be submitted within a week of the original due date with a 2 point penalty.
