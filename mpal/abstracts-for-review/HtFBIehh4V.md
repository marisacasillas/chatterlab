### Caregiver behavior that facilitates vocal turn-taking with prelinguistic infants

What aspects of social interaction facilitate communicative development? Infant babbling in caregiver-infant interactions is crucial for infants’ language development (e.g. Goldstein & Schwade, 2010). In everyday learning environments, prelinguistic vocalizations happen in turn-taking interactions with their caregivers (Gratier et al., 2015). These early turn-taking interactions predict later language skills (Warlaumont, Richards, Gilkerson & Oller, 2014; Romeo et al., 2018; Hirsh-Pasek & Golinkoff, 2017). However, we know little about the time course of infant vocalizations within a turn-taking bout. When infants receive a contingent parental response to a vocalization, what happens next? Infant vocal quality tends to become more mature as a result of parental responding (Goldstein, King & West, 2003), but we do not know if responding influences the likelihood of infant vocalizing. Do infants contribute to vocal turn-taking by vocalizing in response to their parents’ contingent behavior? We 1) categorized parental responses to infant vocalizations as vocal or non-vocal, as well as sensitive or redirective, 2) calculated the babbling elicitation rate of caregivers’ responses and 3) plotted the response latency (RL) distribution of infant responses to their parents. 



Fifty-one mothers and their 9-month-old infants participated in a 15-min unstructured play session. The dyads were asked to play as at home in a 3.7-m x 5.5-m playroom containing infant toys. Infant vocalization onsets and offsets were coded. We coded the modality and sensitivity of caregiver contingent responses to infant vocalizations (Table 1). Infant vocalizations that occurred within 2 sec before or after the end of the caregiver response were counted as elicited. Infant RL was calculated by subtracting caregiver offset from infant onset. Elicitation rate was calculated as the number of elicited infant vocalizations divided by the total number of caregiver behaviors.



We found that caregiver vocal responses had a higher elicitation rate than non-vocal responses, and sensitive responses had a higher elicitation rate than redirective responses. We tested the modality and RL effects as well as sensitivity and RL effects with mixed-effects linear regression models in R (Bates, Maechler & Dai, 2009) of elicitation rate. Type III sum of squares analyses on both models revealed main effects of modality (vocal or non-vocal), sensitivity (sensitive or redirective), RL (9 time bins) and interactions between RL and modality as well as RL and type (all p < 0.0001). Infant RL to caregiver vocal (M  = 0.36, SE = 0.05) or sensitive behaviors (M = 0.14, SE = 0.09) peaked at 0-0.5s , while that to non-vocal (M = 0.12, SE = 0.22) or redirective (M = 0.22, SE = 0.19) behaviors was distributed uniformly, without a clear peak (Figure 1).



Our data suggest that the modality (vocal v. nonvocal) and sensitivity (sensitive v. redirective) of caregivers’ responses differentially elicit infants’ vocalizations and thus influence vocal turn-taking. Since the amount of conversational turns influences children’s language performance (Romeo et al., 2018), it is crucial that we understand what increases infants’ vocal responses and extends the turn taking interactions. We found that caregivers who respond verbally to their infants and who respond sensitively are more likely to get infants to talk back, increasing the number of turns. Our data contribute to the broader turn-taking literature by highlighting the bidirectional effects of vocal turn-taking, in which caregivers’ vocal and sensitive responses to babbling may serve as a training ground for the extension of early vocal turn-taking.
