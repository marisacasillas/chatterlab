### Developmental effects in the on-line use of morphosyntactic markers: Evidence from Tagalog

Studies have shown cross-linguistic differences in children’s real-time use of morphosyntactic markers for thematic role assignment. Experiments in Turkish have revealed that children as young as 4 years can already use case marking to predict the upcoming second noun (Özge, Küntay, & Snedeker, 2019), while studies in German have demonstrated that even at the age of 6, children are not as efficient as adults in using case markers on-line (Schipke, Knoll, Friederici, & Oberecker, 2012). Based on models of language processing which assume that the parser makes use of distributional information (connectionist: e.g., Chang, Dell, & Bock, 2006; expectation-based: e.g., Levy, 2008), this difference may be due to the consistency of the case markers and the frequency of patient-initial sentences in the language. In this research, we tested this prediction in Tagalog (Austronesian), an understudied verb-initial language that uses pre-nominal morphosyntactic markers to assign thematic roles (i.e., voice-marking on the verb and a prenominal marker).



In Tagalog, the agent voice -um- indicates that the ang-marked noun is the agent [Table 1a, b], while the patient voice -in- marks the ang-phrase as the patient [Table 1c, d]. Post-verb word order is relatively flexible. Evidence from child-directed speech shows that the patient voice is overall more frequent, as well as the agent-initial order (Garcia, Roeser, & Höhle, 2019). Given this distribution, children are expected to learn the patient voice mapping before that of the agent voice, as children have more exposure to the former than the latter, facilitating the rapid implementation of online parsing decisions.



To test this hypothesis, we conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 32 adults (controls) and 151 children (fifty-three 5-year-olds, forty-nine 7-year-olds, forty-nine 9-year-olds), who saw a picture depicting a transitive action between two animals. After 1500ms of silence, they heard an audio-recorded sentence [Table 1a-d] that corresponded to the picture. They were told to pay attention because there would be questions about what they had seen and heard. There were 32 experimental items (8 per sentence condition) and 32 fillers. Our independent variables were voice and the order of the thematic roles; and the dependent variable was the proportion of fixations to the agent in the picture. Our analyses determined whether participants looked at the referent of the upcoming noun even before it is mentioned (Noun1 region), based on the voice-marking on the verb and the noun marker that they had previously encountered. 



A permutation analysis revealed that the ability to use morphosyntactic markers to assign thematic roles develops with age. The 5-year-olds showed divergence in the looks to the agent between agent-initial and patient-initial conditions only after the noun onset. However, similar to adults, 7- and 9-year-old children showed predictive use of the morphosyntactic markers in the patient voice. Thus, in Figure 1 (bottom panel), 7-year-olds looked more to the agent during the pre-noun regions when the sentence was agent-initial than when it was patient-initial (significant regions are shaded grey). However, in the agent voice we only found divergence after noun onset.

 

Our results showed that children’s online use of morphosyntactic markers develops with age, with adult-like online predictive processing only beginning to emerge at 7 years. Furthermore, we found that the real-time use of the markers is modulated by voice—with the patient voice being used more efficiently than the agent voice. We interpret this to reflect the participants’ sensitivity to the distributional properties of the language in line with expectation-based and connectionist sentence processing models.
