### Language acquisition in time of Covid-19 – a multi-site, multi-country, multi-language study

In an attempt to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, kindergartens closed nation-widely across the globe. In the current, preregistered, longitudinal study, we evaluate the consequences of home-“schooling” on language acquisition in 8-36-month-old children. In particular, we aim to assess home activities and infant-parent interactions during confinement, and their role in early vocabulary development.

We hypothesized that vocabulary gains during confinement would be modulated by (a) differences in SES, as low-SES families might provide their children with a learning environment less conducive to rapid increases in vocabulary size (Kelly et al., 2011, Melhuish et al., 2008), and (b) activities that parents engage in with their children during confinement; positive effects of shared book reading and structured parent-infant interactions, and negative effects of screen exposure (O'Farrelly et al., 2018; Sénéchal & Young, 2008).

To test these hypotheses, we contacted parents of young children via social media and participants databases and asked them to fill in Communicative Development Inventories (CDI) early (T1) and towards the end (T2) of the confinement period, supplemented with questions about daily routines and activities parents engaged in with their children during confinement.

Preliminary results on data collected in Norway (n=182) confirmed our hypotheses that parent-infant interactions (in particular, free-play with a child) predicted larger increases in vocabulary (in both production and comprehension) while tablet/iPad-based games had negative impact on vocabulary gains in comprehension. While our initial analyses did not find any impact of SES, higher SES (as indicated by mother’s education level) was correlated, on the one hand, with less screen exposure and digital baby games use, and, on the other hand, with more book reading and free-play with the child. 

In parallel, data collection is about to be finished across a dozen countries (e.g., France, Germany, UK, Turkey, USA, Canada, Russia) with over 4000 children contributing to data at T1.
