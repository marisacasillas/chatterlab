### Examining verb-action co-occurrences in everyday contexts in Spanish-speaking and English-speaking families

Experimental studies of verb learning use varied methods including preferential looking and behavioral enactment.  Across these methods, children often hear a new verb while seeing a novel event during a learning phase.  However, there is little data about the frequency with which children see a relevant action with a corresponding verb in everyday contexts.  We observed Spanish- and English-speaking mother/toddler dyads to discover how often children see relevant events while hearing verbs.



Spanish-speaking (n= 10 dyads, in Guatemala City, Guatemala and Santiago, Chile) and English-speaking children (n= 10, in Austin, Texas) were recruited.  Half were male; half were aged 19-25 months while half were aged 27-36m.  Participants were matched for age, gender, and siblings, and were videotaped playing in their home. Two 45-60 minute samples were recorded (one with a standardized set of toys). Coders watched sessions second-by-second, noting the exact time a verb was said by the parent or child, and whether a relevant action was available in the scene. 



Overall, analyses show no significant differences by language.  For example, the rate of action-verb co-occurences was similar across languages (Spanish: Mprop=.11,SD=.08; English: Mprop=.12,SD=.06).  Instead, differences emerged by age (see Table 1).  In verb productions, independent samples t-tests reveal developmental change in the children’s verb productions, t(18)= -2.80, p=.012, but not mothers’ productions, t(18)=1.28, ns, suggesting that parents do not adjust their verb productions as children’s productions increase.  



To test how often events accompanied verbs, we calculated the mean proportion of verbs that co-occurred with relevant events in the scene.  We found similarly low rates across ages (younger: Mprop= .13, SE=.02; older: Mprop=.10, SE=.02).  Put simply, children only saw relevant actions when they heard a new verb 10-13% of the time.  To examine the specific contexts in which events were present when verbs were heard, a RM ANOVA with action (3: action seen by child, done by child, both seen and done) by Age (2: younger, older), dv= proportion verbs, reveals a main effect of action, F(2,18)=76.79, p<.001, np2 =.81, with children most likely to hear a verb referring to their own action (Mprop.= .61,SE=.04) as compared to one seen performed by the parent (Mprop.= .29,SE= .03) or both (Mprop.=.07, SE=.02) (Fig 1). In addition, although we coded for actions within 10 seconds of the verb occurrence, the average link between verbs and actions was M=3 seconds (SD= 2s; range: immediate-7s).   



In sum, empirical studies of children’s verb learning usually present children with co-occurring relevant events.  However, our data show that this is relatively rare in everyday contexts.  It also shows similarities across these two language groups.  Children increased their verb productions across the 1.5 year age span, while mothers’ productions stayed the same.  Additionally, children heard verbs without seeing relevant events at least 87% of the time. When verbs were produced, it was often for children’s actions, with a tight link (within 3s) between verbs and events. Thus, experimental studies that emulate these learning conditions are needed. It is important to know how children learn verbs to understand how they acquire their native language.
