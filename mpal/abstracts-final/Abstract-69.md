#### Preference for deletion vs. epenthesis in Japanese phonological adaptions

The current study investigated whether Japanese non-loan words prefer deletion or epenthesis in their phonological adaptation. In general, non-loan Japanese words prefer deletion by default, while loanwords prefer epenthesis [1,3]. For example, when a Japanese non-loan verb, yomu ‘read’, becomes its causative form, passive form and potential form, the stem of the verb yom has to be suffixed by sase (causative), rare (passive), and re (potential). Due to the Japanese language not allowing consonant clusters, the causative form, yom-sase, the passive form, yom-rare, and the potential form, yom-re, should be adjusted to dissolve the clusters with stem-ending consonants and suffix-initial consonants. Deletion is preferred to epenthesis for these formations, i.e., the causative form is yom-ase (yom-sase) rather than yom-V-sase, the passive form is yom-are (yom-rare) rather than yom-V-rare, and the potential form is yom-e (yom-re) rather than yom-V-re.

In addition, early studies on Japanese loanwords suggested that the input medium (i.e., text-input or sound-input) of the source words affects the adaptations; text-input leads to epenthesis while sound-input leads to deletion [2,4]. According to this account, most Japanese loanwords prefer epenthesis because the loanwords were mostly imported in text. Japanese non-loan words’ preferences for deletion is compatible with this account because non-loan words should have emerged in sound-input, as languages initially emerge in sound without texts, in general. On the other hand, the present study investigated how native Japanese speakers adapt non-loan words when they are input in text. Japanese speakers may prefer deletion if it is the default method for non-loan word adaptation, but the effect from the input-medium could appear with more reliance on epenthesis for text-input.

An experiment was conducted with 20 native Japanese-speaking participants. As the experimental items, the participants were given 5 nonce words written in Japanese hiragana texts, which were all verbs with consonant-ending stems. Participants were tasked to create the nonce verbs’ causative, passive and potential forms by adding the suffixes sase, rare, and re, respectively, which requires either deletion or epenthesis.

The omnibus analysis for the results showed that there were significant (and marginally significant) preferences for deletion to epenthesis [F1 =11.09, p =.004; F2 =5.90, p =.072]. This outcome may support the argument, which suggests that phonological adaptation for non-loan Japanese prefers deletion by default. However, individual analyses for each form indicated that the causative form showed significant preferences for deletion [t1 =3.90, p =.018; t2 =3.56, p =.002], the passive form showed no significant preference [t1 =.44, p =.685; t2 =.648, p =.525],  and the potential form showed significant and marginally significant preferences for deletion [t1 =3.60, p =.002; t2 =2.75, p =.052]. The inconsistent outcome may indicate that the default-ness of deletion is not an absolute one, in spite of formations of existing Japanese verbs appear to consistently prefer deletion. Also, it is possible that the default-ness of deletion as well as the effect from the input medium could be selective in response to different types of formations.
