Most papers addressing gestures as nonverbal means of communication start with the observation that people in general and children in specific move their hand when they talk (e.g., Novack & Goldin-Meadow, 2015). In this work, we ask whether such generally observed gestural behavior changes in dependence on what communicative task is performed. The question is motivated by the assumption that communicative tasks differ with respect to the underlying cognitive and interactive demands. For children, this question is important, because in research, a relation between children’s communicative competences and their nonverbal behavior is discussed. In this discussion, however, communicative competences are considered on a general level, with little attention to children’s communicative competences in specific tasks. Whereas developmental research suggests that a child might, for example, eloquently retell a story but struggle with an explanation, studies on this difference in nonverbal modality are scarce. After introducing the term of communicative genre, we will use it as a lens to analyze children’s iconic co-speech gestures. 

In our study, 46 German-speaking children at the age of 4 participated in three different tasks (Explanation, Retelling, and Illustration) that were performed with parents to elicit a natural behavior. In our analysis, we differentiated between interactive and congitive functions of iconic co-speech gestures. In their interactive function, gestures are practices or techniques that occur visibly in speakers. The terms practices / techniques refer to manual schemata that are established and performed by a group of people. We followed the taxonomy developed by Cartmill et al (2017), according to which three handshapes give rise to gesture-to-world mappings in a different way: gestures of the type hand-as-hand, hand-as-object, and hand-as-neutral.

Based on great variability reported for children’s verbal competencies in different genres, we hypothesized that in its interactive function, the gestural behavior of the children (in terms of the amount of iconic gestures) will also differ with respect to the genres.

In their cognitive function, gestures aid a cognitive construction, in which an experience or a phenomenon is recalled. We investigated this function in the Retelling condition by exposting the children to a story presented with video or a book that was then recalled by the children.

To control for children’s verbosity, we calculated the proportions of iconic gestures with respect to the intonation pharases. We decided for intonation phrases, because we found that in children, it is difficult to determine what could count as a complete sentence/utterance. 

We conducted a repeated measures ANOVA on the proportions of iconic gestures (as a dependent variable) and the communicative genre as independent variable. We applied  Bonferroni corrected posthoc for pairwise comparisons within subjects for the posthoc tests.

We found support for our hypothesis, according to which the amount and types of children’s iconic gesture use differ depending on the interactive demands of the genre. Overall, we found a trend suggesting that gestures occur less during Retelling that in other genres. When looking at the correlation of the different types, we found more similarity between Retelling and Illustration (with the pattern of hand-as-hand correlating with hand-as-object) than in Explanation, which latter genre gave rise to more gestures of the type hand-as-neutral and a correlation between this type and hand-as-hand. The genres seem thus to raise specific interactive demands reflected by the differences in gestural occurrence.

With respect to the cognitive demands, we found that children gesture more when they recall a story from a video in comparison to a picture book that was read to them—a finding that lines up with previous literature (Hostetter & Alibali, 2008).
