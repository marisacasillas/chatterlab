This presentation will bring together recent findings (published and in progress) stemming from studies of the original English Language Use Inventory (LUI) [1, 2], and of five translations, namely the LUI-Arabic [3], LUI-Polish [4], LUI-Portuguese [5], LUI-Italian [6] and LUI-French [7]. The LUI, a standardized parent-report measure, assesses pragmatic language functioning across a broad variety of everyday settings, including the purposes for which 18- to 47-month-old children use language (e.g., to ask for help, to share something of interest, to direct others in play), their conversational topics, and how they adapt communication to context. 

     The prior lack of tools to systematically elicit such information from parents about children's language use before the age of 4 years in everyday, meaningful social interactions has meant that less is known about how pragmatic aspects of language develop in children than about how aspects of grammar or vocabulary develop. However, the availability of the LUI since 2009, and subsequent translations of the measure, now provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore pragmatic development within and across languages. 

     The first goal of our presentation is to convey some of the challenges associated with translating and adapting a measure focused on pragmatics and the ways these were resolved, resulting in strong psychometric support for the translations. The results add to evidence of the original LUI's reliability, validity, and sensitivity [1, 8]; properties which have already led to its widespread adoption in clinical practice and in research with diverse populations (e.g., children with hearing impairment, Down syndrome, or autism). The second goal is to take a comparative approach, using findings from studies of the LUIâ€™s translations to explore and discuss crosslinguistic similarities in pragmatic development as well as more language-specific patterns (e.g., the performance of boys versus girls at different ages). The results of these studies, taken together, underscore more similarities than differences in the growth of social pragmatic functions of language acquired in the early years across children living in different countries and learning different languages. They also are a strong validation of the importance and use of parent-report measures to gain an in-depth picture of a young 2- or 3-year-oldsâ€™ language development.
