Most mathematics classrooms world-wide exhibit language diversity. In some cases teacher and students speak different languages and must find ways to communicate in a common tongue. In other arenas, teacher and students may share a common ‘school language’ while home languages and informal ways of expressing observations differ. In every classroom, students and teachers must together navigate everyday, school and technical register in one or more language (Prediger & Wessel, 2011). As language diversity has increased, so have calls for increased verbal engagement and sense-making on the part of students. This call for more meaningful participation means that the importance of language socialization events and the tension of navigating across languages and registers also increases (Barwell, 2020).



In this project, I sought to identify ways teachers in Dutch schools adapt mathematics instruction to meet the needs of an increasingly language-diverse population. I visited 34 mathematics classrooms in which home language diversity was present. The schools fell broadly into two categories. Some held language acquisition (either Dutch or English) along with learning mathematics as an explicit goal. Others held mathematical proficiency alone as an explicit goal. In each classroom, I observed for most of a school day, interviewed students, and interviewed the teacher about language diversity in relation to mathematics instruction. As I analyzed my observations I found that where both language and mathematical learning were goals, teachers tended to invite rather than compel participation.



I found these settings resembled at times what Barwell (2020) described as language positive classrooms. During moments of tension as students and teachers labored to understand each other, home languages were accepted, students tried out ideas in informally, and teachers attended to gestures to understand students’ meaning. Teachers generally supported students with explicit mathematical genres and provided structure for students’ mathematical conversations with each other. In the oral communication, I will discuss and interrogate these language socialization patterns and their implications for language-diverse mathematics classrooms in detail.
