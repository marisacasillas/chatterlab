Background. Adult bilingualism research provides considerable evidence for language co-activation in the form of between-language lexical priming (e.g., Kroll et al., 2006), whereas research on such effects in bilingual children is limited and largely restricted to toddlers (e.g., Von Holzen & Mani, 2012). Individual-level factors, known to influence co-activation in adults (e.g., Van Hell & Tanner, 2012), have not yet been systematically investigated in children. Therefore, the current study aims to uncover:
1. to what extent between-language priming at the phonological level and the conceptual level takes place in school-aged simultaneous bilingual children;
2. how between-language priming compares to within-language priming; 
3. how within- and between-language priming are affected by children's individual differences in proficiency, exposure and use.

Method. 26 Greek-Dutch simultaneous bilingual children, aged 4;10-9;2, matched pictures to auditorily presented Dutch target words and Greek and Dutch prime words, while their eye movements were recorded. Following Von Holzen & Mani (2012), Singh (2014), and Floccia et al. (2020), prime and target words overlapped phonologically (e.g., between-language: roda(GR) 'wheel'-rok(NL) 'skirt'), conceptually (e.g., fousta(GR) 'skirt'-rok(NL)), or phonologically mediated by conceptual overlap (e.g., vrachos(GR) 'rock'-rots(NL) 'rock'-rok(NL)). Participants were tested in two sessions: a Dutch-to-Dutch and a Greek-to-Dutch priming session. The Dutch-to-Dutch session was repeated with a monolingual Dutch control group. Proficiency was assessed using sentence repetition and vocabulary tasks, exposure and use using a parental questionnaire. We predicted:
1. priming effects at all levels of lexical representation, including mediated priming;
2. stronger within-language than between-language priming effects;
3. stronger within-language effects (i.e., Dutch-to-Dutch priming) for participants with stronger Dutch proficiency, and stronger between-language effects for participants with stronger proficiency in both languages.

Results. Linear mixed effects models of reaction times revealed:
1. between-language phonological, conceptual, and mediated priming effects;
2. within-language priming effects at the conceptual level only, for both monolingual and bilingual children;
3. effects of individual differences in both within- and between-language conditions. Within-language priming effects interacted with bilingual participants' proportion of Dutch exposure and use. Mediated priming effects were affected by their proportion of Greek use.
For eye-tracking, we expect to find priming effects in all conditions, given the direct, sensitive nature of this method.

Discussion. These results provide new evidence for language co-activation in simultaneous bilingual children at both the phonological and the conceptual level of lexical representation, and demonstrate that the degree of co-activation depends on individual-level factors. By showing which sources of variation between bilingual children constrain their lexical processing, the present results also contribute to our understanding of individual differences in children's language processing in general.
