Prior linguistic knowledge is proposed to facilitate vocabulary consolidation, akin to the ways in which cognitive schema facilitate the acquisition of new declarative knowledge (James et al., 2017). The accumulated language knowledge learners bring to the task of word learning presents a source of variation between individuals and across development: adults have typically acquired more prior knowledge that can support learning relative to children. However, children experience a higher proportion of slow-wave sleep stages that are associated with memory consolidation, and may be less reliant on prior knowledge to support new learning (Wilhelm et al., 2012). We conducted two sets of three pre-registered experiments examining how children (aged 7-10 years) and adults benefit from related lexical knowledge during word learning and subsequent consolidation (osf.io/s2628; osf.io/stx6q). 



We taught participants pseudowords that varied in their number of English phonological neighbours (none, one, many), and tested recall and recognition of the pseudowords at three test points (immediately after learning, the next day, one week later). Under an explicit training regime, both children and adults benefited from phonological neighbours at the immediate test point, but offline consolidation reduced the benefit on longer-term memory (James et al., 2018). In an incidental learning paradigm in which the pseudowords were embedded in spoken stories, the neighbourhood benefit was less robust and did not change over time (manuscript in preparation). While access to prior lexical knowledge did not seem to differ between children and adults (or relate to individual differences in vocabulary ability), the role for offline mechanisms did: children consistently demonstrated greater improvements in recall across the course of the week in exploratory analyses. These offline benefits were most striking for pseudowords without phonological neighbours, such that only adults retained a lasting benefit for prior knowledge. 



In conclusion, phonological neighbour benefits can be reduced following offline consolidation in some circumstances, suggesting that related lexical knowledge and offline processes play complementary—rather than interacting—roles in supporting vocabulary acquisition. However, phonological neighbours have a limited role in accounting for individual variability in word learning, and we consider alternative ways in which learners’ prior knowledge might drive differences in vocabulary learning. We highlight the capacity of the developing brain to consolidate new language, and the importance of examining the longevity of prior knowledge influences on new word acquisition.
