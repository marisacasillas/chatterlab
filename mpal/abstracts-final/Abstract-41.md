An attempt is made to assess the existence of functional categories in young bilingually developing children. Theoretically, the study adheres to the notions of Strong Continuity Hypothesis (SCH) (Lust, 1999). SCH emphasizes that the complete functional structure is available in early stages of first language acquisition and is developed according to mental operating principles which are available through Universal Grammar (Chomsky 1981). Children have the ability to delineate the parameters of ambient language/s and acquire functional categories pertaining to inflection, gender, and tense contrast in early stages of language acquisition.  In bilingual environment children are able to set the parameters of more than one language and can acquire two languages successfully. 

The objective of this paper was to assess acquisition of functional categories in bilingually developing children; we have included social variables as well. Therefore, the study was inclusive of perspectives from psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics. To understand the acquisition process we need psycholinguistic issues, and to understand the context of learning sociolinguistic variables are inevitable. 

In order to procure data, comprehension, production and judgment tasks related to Agreement Phrase (AgrP), Tense phrase (TP) and Complementizer phrase (CP) were administered to 127 Hindi-English 3-6 years old bilingually developing children. The tasks were developed in two languages; in Hindi and in English. The data collection was carried out in northern part of India where Hindi is a major language; English coexists with Hindi in social, cultural and educational environments. 

Comprehension task was comprised of three sub-sets: 1) picture selection, 2) identification and 3) lexical concept. 

The production task was comprised of two subsets: 1) Production sentence, 2) Agreement. ‘Production sentence’ task was composed of narrative pictures. ‘Agreement’ task was composed of grammatically wrong sentences violating agreement rules. Children were asked to evaluate the sentences as ‘right’ or ‘wrong’. 

The Judgment task was composed of silly statements.  Children were asked to judge them for semantic correctness . 

Data were coded and entered in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. All statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). 

The result of the assessment provided the evidence that children have acquired parameters of two languages.  The study also concludes that early grammar of bilingually developing children was well structured. We have got evidence that the knowledge about Agreement Phrase (AgrP), Tense phrase (TP) and Complementizer phrase (CP) was available with children in early years.  Children have comprehended Person, Number and Gender (PNG) markers in both the languages with right values. Both the languages differ in word order parameter. English is head initial language where as Hindi is head final language. More over Hindi is a prodrop language where English is not. The results have provided the evidence that children’s utterances were error free as far as word order and prodrop parameter was concerned. It may be concluded that bilingually developing children acquire two grammatical systems. 

X2 test was used to assess bivariate association between categorical variables. If probability associated with the X2 test was <0.05; we asserted that correlation between variables was significant.
