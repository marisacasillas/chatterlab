A key problem for fields of language acquisition and language intervention is that children's achievement of truly life-relevant substantial advances in language skills under well-specified causal conditions has seldom been revealed. This limits refinements of theory and refinements of educational/clinical approaches. Rigorous causal experiments which actually triggered clear cut acquisition by children of syntactic, semantic, and narrative structures are a powerful methodological foundation for understanding language acquisition processes and individual pathways.

  Here we present 3 separate, well-controlled intervention experiments (@20 or more children). The actual poster/talk will include brief information on still more related studies, with a range of participants widely varying across typical development, language delay, deafness, and autism spectrum disorders.

  Study 1. Children received conversational treatment for complex syntactic structures such as passives, relative clauses, coordinative conjunctions, and infinitives.  They acquired these structures, but also made substantial gains on vocabulary tests. Surprisingly, but of great theoretical interest, under the richly supportive and challenging interventions language delayed children showed intact acquisition mechanisms by matching the progress rate of typically developing children.  This was true despite a high degree of language delay before intervention--2 to  3 years below normative. 

  Study 2.  Here all children were children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI).  Their progress was a replication of the language acquisition outcomes in Study 1. The causal nature of the conversational treatment for syntax was illuminated by double controls. First, each participant was tracked on control syntactic structures which received no treatment whatsoever, and for all such control targets progress was zero or extremely minimal.  Second, matching for language levels, a comparison group of SLI who were put on a waiting list and thus receiving no treatment also failed to show advances in syntax--for all cases progress was zero or extremely minimal.

  Study 3. Children received dialogic treatment for narrative complexities and coherence (cf. Veneziano & Nicolopoulou, 2019).  They not only acquired new narrative structures, but also made significant gains on vocabulary and complex syntax.

  Conclusions. In the context of the  prior literature, the outcomes covered above are exceptional. A key reason for this is that the preceding intervention work almost never presented such high language challenges studied across multiple months of intervention.  The experiments also share these  two key elements which need to be given attention in any theory of language acquisition:

1. By framing each intervention within Dynamic Systems (Thelen & Smith, 1994) , a  strong emphasis was placed upon creating converging and positive social-emotional engagement to accompany any presentation of a target challenge and to embed patterns of conversation that would increase processing ease. Further, positive expectations kept increasing across time as  early signs of progress and deeper engagement emerged between the child and the experimenter/clinician. These conditions in the treatment dynamic mixes served to perturb acquisition mechanisms toward focused processing and learning of new language structures.

  2.  Beyond the remarkable overall pace of acquisition during intervention, detailed individual pathways were revealed which indicated that the basically same presentation patterns across children triggered sub-steps that were strikingly different among the children as they each moved toward full acquisition of language structure
