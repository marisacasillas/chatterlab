Introduction

Recent meta-analytic structural equation modelling studies reported strong to moderate interrelations between language, literacy and related traits, such as working memory (WM), spanning childhood to adolescence. A considerable part of these relationships can be attributed to shared genetic factors. However, our knowledge of multivariate genetic architectures across language and literacy and phonological working memory (PWM) has thus far been largely based on twin studies. Here, we structurally modelled multivariate genetic variance between reading fluency, spelling, phonemic awareness, oral language comprehension and PWM (non-word repetition) in 6,453 unrelated children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) with genome-wide information. 

Methods 

11 language- and literacy-related measures, including PWM, were assessed in 7- to 13-year old ALSPAC participants. Multivariate genetic architectures were investigated with Genetic-relationship-matrix structural equation modelling (GSEM) using novel combined Independent Pathway / Cholesky (IPC) models. The IPC model structures the genetic variance as an Independent Pathway model (with shared and specific genetic factors) and the residual variance according to a Cholesky decomposition. Thus, it combines the identification of shared genetic factor structures with a saturated model fit of residual variances, without loss of model fit.

Results 

Model fit comparisons with respect to exclusively Cholesky or Independent Pathway models showed that the IPC model fitted the data best. A single shared genetic factor explained the majority of genetic variance in non-word, word and passage reading fluency, ranging between 82%(SE=9%) for word reading speed to 93%(SE=4%) for passage reading accuracy. Utilising passage reading accuracy as a proxy of reading fluency, we identified a shared genetic factor that almost fully explained genetic variance in literacy (>90%, reading fluency, spelling, phonemic awareness) and to a lesser extent genetic variance in oral language (44%) and PWM (53%). Sensitivity analysis showed that the estimated common factor structures were robust and independent of reading fluency proxy selection. Despite these commonalities, oral language (56%) and PWM (47%) had large specific genetic factor contributions resulting in moderate genetic correlations with literacy-related measures. Also, residual correlations with literacy-related measures were low, especially for oral language. In contrast, literacy-only measures were both genetically and residually strongly correlated.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest a spectrum of interrelated, but aetiologically different cognitive skill sets contributing to language, literacy and PWM performance. The pattern of identified genetic and residual structures is consistent with mediated pleiotropy implicating, predominantly, effects of language on literacy.
