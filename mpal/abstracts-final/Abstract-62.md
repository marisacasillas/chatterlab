Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) is the most common childhood disorder. It is becoming increasingly clear that the key to its ultimately remediation lies in understanding the early mechanisms that come into play as the developing brain assembles functional networks. Basic auditory perception develops very early in life and is involved in language acquisition. Studies from our research group show that (a) early auditory processing is impaired in infants at familial risk for DLD and (b) it impacts later linguistic development. These pieces of evidence pave the way to the development of interventions that may be administered early in life within the period of known maximum cerebral plasticity. The overall study aims at developing an innovative and ecological early intervention based on environmental auditory enrichment to be tested on infants with/without risk for DLD (7-9 months of age), in an attempt to modify their developmental trajectories before the emergence and crystallization of any behavioural symptoms. Here, the efficacy of the intervention on typically developing infants (without risk for DLD) is tested on the electrophysiological markers of auditory processing and on early linguistic skills investigated before and after the intervention activities.

27 typically developing 6-month-olds participated to this study: 13 infants participated to the early auditory intervention (INT+) whereas 14 did not (INT-). The intervention provides exposure to and active synchronization with complex musical rhythms (through specific “tapping” and “bouncing” tasks). It took place in small groups of infant-caregiver pairs (N=4) for 1 hour/week for 6 weeks and indications were given to caregivers in order to continue the interventions at home. All infants underwent the same evaluations. Basic auditory skills at age 6 and 12 months were characterized via EEG/ERP using a double-deviant oddball paradigm. Pairs of tones were presented at a rapid rate (70ms inter-stimulus interval) and stimuli differing in either frequency or duration served as deviants. At age 6 and 12 months also expressive and receptive early language skills were assessed by means of standardized tests (Bayley Scales).  

The results show that INT+ infants presented at age 12 months a more mature ERP pattern, characterized by shorter latency of the P1 component (standard stimuli) and enhanced P2 component (MisMatch Response). Interestingly, such ERP pattern resembles that of INT- children at age 24 months (see Figure 1). In addition, comparisons between groups in the linguistic measures show significantly broader improvement in INT+ infants, both concerning expressive and receptive language skills (F(1,25) = 4.74 p = .039 and F(1,25) = 11.40 p = .002, respectively – see Figure 2). 

Taken together, these results provide some preliminary evidence on the efficacy of an early intervention based on active acoustic experience in modifying infants’ neuronal and electrophysiological functioning underlying auditory processing skills, as well as early linguistic competences. The next steps of the present study will include the investigation of the efficacy that this intervention may have on infants with a family history for DLD, who have higher risk of atypical linguistic developmental trajectories.
