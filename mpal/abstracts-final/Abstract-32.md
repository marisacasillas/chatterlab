BACKGROUND

In bilingual settings, language contact can sometimes lead to cross-linguistic influence. Earlier studies have found that this particularly occurs when there is partial overlap between languages: when one language offers an alternative between two patterns, a learner of that language tends to overgeneralize the pattern that also exists in the other (for an overview see Moro, 2016). This has been called the Alternation Hypothesis (Jansen et al., 1981; Heine, 2008). This study investigated whether the acquisition of the Dutch pluralization is affected by early exposure to English in the context of Dutch-English bilingual daycare centers. The Dutch plural can be formed by adding the -en or the -s affix:



a.	Eén stoel, twee stoelen (‘one chair, two chairs’)

b.	Eén tafel, twee tafels (‘one table, two tables’)



The English language only offers the -s affix in case of pluralization. Due to this partial overlap, it could be predicted that children in the process of acquiring the Dutch plural system may show a stronger preference for -s if they are also exposed to English.



METHOD

A group of 141 two- and three-year-old children growing up with Dutch and/or English at home and who attended monolingual (Dutch-only) or bilingual (Dutch-English) daycare participated in a Sentence Completion Task. In this task, the participants were presented with a dollhouse, its doll occupants and some of its furnishings.  The experimenter told the participants that they had brought more furnishings that had to be placed inside the house by the participants, and that she would hand them the objects one by one. 



To elicit plurals, the  experimenter would introduce and name two objects (e.g.: 'Look what I brought, a bed! But I didn’t just bring one bed, I brought another bed.’) Then, the experimenter would offer a sentence frame for the child to describe the objects (e.g. ‘So I didn’t just bring one bed, but two….?’). The participants were then prompted to complete the sentence.



In total, sixteen Dutch plurals were elicited. Eight months later, 59 out of the 141 children participated in a follow-up measurement in which they completed the same task. For each participant an English exposure measure (including English exposure at home and at daycare) was calculated on the basis of a parental questionnaire.



RESULTS

A generalized logistic mixed effect model showed that more English exposure was associated with an increased chance of children using the –s affix: an interaction effect was found between amount of English exposure and Type. This indicated that the more children were exposed to English, the more likely they were to form a plural with an –s when an –en affix was required (z=3.395, p<.001). No evidence was found for an increase or decrease of the effect of English exposure on the chances to form a plural with an –s over time, since no interaction effect between Exposure and Time was found (z=-0.662 , p=0.508). 



CONCLUSION

This study provides evidence for cross-linguistic influence from English to Dutch in the acquisition of Dutch pluralization: early exposure to English in two and three-year-old children leads to a higher chance of overgeneralization of the -s affix when an -en affix is required. No evidence was found for an increase or decrease of this cross-linguistic influence from English to Dutch over time.
