Relative clauses (RCs) are complex syntactic structures because they are grammatical constructions that consist of multiple clauses and also involve syntactic movement. They have been previously found as reliable indicative markers of syntactic impairment in different languages. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have been found to struggle with comprehension and production of RCs, and it remains unclear whether these difficulties stem from a pragmatic or a syntactic deficit. Furthermore, most previous studies were conducted with English-speaking participants. The current study tested Hebrew-speaking children—37 children with ASD (age 8–17 years) and 24 typically developing children (age 8 years)—on a semi-structured definition task. Typically developing children were found to produce more RCs than children with ASD. Children with ASD produced mainly pronoun errors and productions of single words instead of sentences. The current study contributes to the discussion regarding whether the syntactic differences seen in the production of some children with ASD are a specific form of language deficit, or merely a delay in language acquisition
