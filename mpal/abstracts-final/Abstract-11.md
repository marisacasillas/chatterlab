The study of cross-linguistic influence has long been the focus of many researchers and has occupied a central role in Second Language (L2) acquisition research. However, most research on cross-linguistic transfer has only considered the influence of the native language on L2 acquisition. Ellis (1985) argues that “the learner's L1 is an important determinant of SLA. It is not the only determinant, however, and may not be the most important. But it is theoretically unsound to attempt a precise specification of its contribution or even try to compare its contribution with that of other factors” (p.40). It is evident that the mother tongue is one of the various possible factors in Second Language Acquisition. Odlin (1989) maintains that “the influence resulting from similarities and differences between the target language and any other language that has been previously (and perhaps imperfectly) acquired” (p. 27). Therefore, the study of interference in Third Language Acquisition (TLA) is essential to show the influence of previous L2 knowledge. This is a recent field of research and there are some gaps in the literature that need to be explored. The aim of the present study is to focus on the acquisition of English as a third language. It is an attempt to identify cross-linguistic influence at the levels of phonetics and grammar, to analyze the features and to show the factors behind them based on the spoken and written performance of the participants. The study is concerned with the Tunisian context in which English is taught as a third language. The informants of the study are with three different interlanguages, namely Arabic, French and English. The cross sectional approach is used in this study to collect data from the participants. There are two groups of participants. The first group is required to record a list of words and the second group is required to write a short essay. Then, the researcher tries to analyze their spoken output using PRAAT and the written output is done manually. The results of study may pave the way for new investigations on TLA. It also has implications for language teaching pedagogy; understanding the system of TLA can help teachers find the suitable pedagogical tools to deal with learners’ errors.
