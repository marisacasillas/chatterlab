Seminal work on language prediction processes has demonstrated that speakers’ language comprehension is incremental and predictive (e.g., Altman & Kamide, 1999; Kamide, 2008).  More recent literature has proposed that speakers activate different object representations during on-line event comprehension (e.g., Hindy et al., 2012; Hindy et al. 2015), and that those objects representations compete for selection during language comprehension. This study investigates the on-line prediction processes in native Spanish speakers, late L2 learners of English. More specifically, it investigates the comprehension of object change state and the linguistic and cognitive underpinnings during event processing (Tolentino & Tokowicz 2011). Three groups of participants were tested at three sites: monolingual English speakers at the University of Connecticut, early English-Spanish speakers at the University of California, Riverside, and late L2 learners of English at the University of Granada. Across the three sites, participants completed a main visual world paradigm task to measure prediction abilities for change of state verbs. For example, they listened to sentences that elicited a minimal or a maximal state change, such as: “The bride will admire/unwrap the gift”, while looking at a computer display with four target objects. In addition, data from a number of cognitive tasks such as attention, memory, inhibitory control, and goal maintenance were collected to better understand how differences in cognitive function modulated the processing of object state change.



The innovative aspect of this project was to understand how individual differences in bilingual language use and cognitive function modulate event processing. This research produced important preliminary findings showing that prediction and cognitive control abilities modulate real-time event processing in native speakers. In addition, contrary to previous findings, the results demonstrated that early and late- bilinguals were also able to predict as accurately as their monolingual counterparts.
