Introduction:

During the first years of life, children master many developmental milestones. Specifically, the motoric transition from crawling to walking is thought to initiate a cascade of developmental events across domains, including subsequent personal-social and language development. However, the underlying aetiological mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we (i) study the complex genetic architecture of these early developmental traits, and (ii) investigate whether infant fine motor, gross motor and personal-social skills (6-18 months) predict later processes of language acquisition (15-38 months), as captured by shared genetic factors. 

Methods:

Parent-reported fine motor, gross motor and personal-social skills (6-18 months) were assessed with the Denver Development Screening Test (DDST) and parent-reported language skills with the Communicative Development Inventories (CDI), as observed in unrelated children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; N<6553, 12 measures) with genome-wide data. SNP-heritability (SNP-h2) and bivariate genetic correlations (rg) were estimated using Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA). Multivariate genetic relationships were studied using Genetic-Relationship-Matrix Structural Equation modelling (GSEM; Cholesky decomposition). To reduce the computational burden for GSEM, we selected variables with proxy character, identifying two motor and one personal-social skills as predictors and five language measures as outcome with an experiment-wide error rate of p=0.005 before GSEM proxy variable selection and p=0.008 afterwards. 

Results: 

Infant motor and personal-social skills, as well as subsequent language skills, have low to modest SNP-h2, with estimates for language skills ranging from 4%(SE=0.06) for the plurals score at 38 months to 20%(SE=0.05) for expressive vocabulary at 38 months. Similar SNP-h2 estimates were obtained for gross motor behaviour at 6 months of age (SNP-h2=20%, SE=0.05) and personal-social skills at 15 months of age (SNP-h =19%, SE=0.05). Latter two traits were both genetically correlated with later language abilities, showing throughout positive relationships (e.g. with expressive vocabulary at 24 months: rg=0.65(SE=0.23, p=0.007) and rg=0.61(SE=0.19, p=0.001) respectively). 

The earliest predictive effects for later language abilities were identified for infant motor behaviour at 6 months of age. Longitudinal Cholesky GSEM analyses demonstrated that especially expressive vocabulary at 24 months and word combination use at 38 months load on a latent genetic factor shared with early infant gross motor skills at 6 months, with standardised factor loadings of 0.25(SE=0.09, p=0.006) and 0.25(SE=0.09, p=0.006) respectively. These shared genetic influences accounted for the majority of phenotypic covariance between these skills, as estimated using bivariate heritability (gross motor-expressive vocabulary: 0.66(SE=0.24, p=0.0065), gross motor-word combination: 0.91(SE=0.33, p=0.006)). Similar patterns were observed for infant personal social skills at 15 months with respect to language performance in toddlerhood. 

Conclusions:

Our findings suggest that both infant gross motor skills and personal-social skills are predictive of subsequent language performance due to shared underlying genetic factors, consistent with developmental priming mechanisms. The strength of this investigation lies in the exclusion of reverse causation bias due to the assessment of infant motor skills preceding the developmental stage of language production at about 12 months of age.
