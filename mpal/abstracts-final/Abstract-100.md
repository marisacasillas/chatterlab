Possession forms are among the earliest utterances produced by children (Brown, 1973). Children typically go through stages of acquisition of possession, as they often begin expressing possession far before they can produce target forms (Marinis, 2016). As different languages use different structures to convey possession, cross-linguistic acquisition of the possession structure offers insight into the role of language structure within acquisition. 



In English, German, Greek, Hebrew, and Japanese, children build possession utterances with units that are attested in target forms (Marinis, 2016). First possession utterances consist of uninflected nouns, with the inflectional system being acquired at a later stage. Data from the polysynthetic language Northern East Cree, however, shows a different pattern (Henke, 2019). In this study, one child (aged 2;1-3;8) evidenced an early stage using an analytic possessive form that was largely unattested in adult speech (which uses primarily synthetic forms), thus circumventing units of the target form altogether until a much later stage when the child could produce units of the target form. In the current study, we ask whether this pattern is specific to Cree or also found across other polysynthetic languages.

 

To this end, we investigated the acquisition of possession forms in Arctic Quebec Inuktitut, a polysynthetic language of Quebec (Dorais, 2010). Inuktitut marks possession through inflections on both the possessor and the possessee. The possessor is inflected with one of 39 ergative case markers indexing the number of the possessor, while the possessee is inflected with one of 252 inflections indexing both the person and number of the possessor as well as the number and case of the possessee. Four constructions are possible, mixing these options (see Figure 1). Recursive nested possession relationships are formed with an additional, often null, constituent (see Figure 2). 



We analyzed spontaneous speech data from three children (aged 2;0-2;9, 2;6-3;3, 3;7-4;4), along with a small subset of input from two caregivers, collected once per month for nine months (Allen, 1996). Possession relationships were found in ~10% of utterances, yielding 1469 possession forms from the three children and 293 forms from the adults. 



The three children showed no early stage lacking possessive inflection, and also no other stages of development in their possession forms. In fact, they showed patterns of possession relationships in their speech that were astonishingly similar to those of their caregivers in terms of overall possession use, the constructions of constituents, and types of possessor and possessee forms. All speakers overwhelmingly preferred the possessee-only construction and showed about equal use of the other three constructions (Figure 1). All three children even produced the more complex nested form (Figure 2). Investigations of younger data are ongoing to pinpoint possible earlier development of possession forms. 



Our results suggest that the “circumventive method” of acquiring possession does not hold for all polysynthetic languages and may be due to additional complexities of possession in Cree. Polysynthetic versus non-polysynthetic is perhaps not a crucial distinction in structural development of possession forms.
