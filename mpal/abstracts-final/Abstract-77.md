This systematic review explores the effect of communication disorders on the natural language environments of young children. The language that children are exposed to everyday influences their long-term language, cognitive, and academic outcomes. Demographic factors that are external to the child, such as socioeconomic status or culture, have been shown to impact language learning. Conversely, internal factors, including ability, may also affect the language stimulation a child receives. Further, different communication disorders may influence language environments differently. For example, children with hearing loss may not be able to access the language stimulation provided to them because it is not clearly audible while children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may not have the ability to interact with the language to which they are exposed. The inability to access or process language may, in turn, influence how adults communicate with children who have communication disorders, thereby placing them at higher risk for more severe language delays. 

Over the last decade, daylong recording tools, like the Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) System, have been used to unobtrusively observe the natural language environments of children with a wide variety of communication abilities. The LENA System can provide an objective measure of the language children use and are exposed to in their daily lives. We have conducted a systematic review of LENA System literature comparing the effects of childhood hearing loss and ASD on the language environments of young children. We hypothesize that both hearing loss and ASD affect language environments and that children with ASD will verbally engage less with adults while producing more vocalizations compared to children with hearing loss.

Evidence acquisition:

PsychINFO, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar were searched in April 2020. Studies that reported data acquired through the use of the LENA System from children with hearing loss or ASD were included, regardless of the inclusion of a typically developing control group. The main outcome measures were average adult word count, child vocalizations, and conversational turns.

Evidence synthesis:

A total of 319 abstracts and 101 full articles were assessed. Seventeen studies fit inclusion criteria (10 HL, 7 ASD) and 7 of those were included in meta-analysis (5 HL, 2 ASD). These 7 studies were the only ones to include both a typically developing control group and the information needed to calculate effect size. Communication disorders had an effect on all 3 language variables. Both children with hearing loss (d=-.33) and ASD (d=-42) demonstrated a reduction in turn-taking compared to typically developing peers. ASD moderately decreased adult words (d=-.63) and child vocalizations (d=-.27) while hearing loss increased them (d=.13; d=.43). These effects were not significantly different between the HL and ASD groups for any measure: average number of turns (F(2,19)=1.2, p=.33), adult words (F(2,15)=.83, p=.46), or child vocalizations (F(2,10)=.48, p=.63). 

Conclusion:

The evidence suggests communication disorders influence language environments and that hearing loss and ASD may have distinct effects. These distinctions are not yet made clear by the current evidence likely due to population variability, small samples in each study, and the precision of currently available daylong recording tools.
