Language speakers come in various guises: adult native speakers; child learners of their native language; learners of a non-native language. Correspondingly, fields of research investigating language development for each type of speaker have grown largely independently. However, given that basic commonalities underlie these different speakers – all are human users of human languages – there is considerable scope for theories which can link explanations of child language development and adult language processing, both native (L1) and non-native (L2). Despite this, current theoretical models differ in the underlying mechanisms of syntax acquisition, with some proposing that speakers use error-based implicit learning to acquire abstract representations of syntax (Chang et al., 2006), while other suggest early stages of syntax learning are lexically dependent (Hartsuiker & Bernolet, 2017; Tomasello, 2003). The aim of this study is to experimentally investigate language learning in different types of speakers (child language learners, second language learners and native adult speakers) in order to develop a more unified theory of language development.



Specifically, we investigate syntactic priming: the tendency of speakers to repeat recently experienced syntactic structures (Bock, 1986). Syntactic priming is a highly pervasive effect that can provide insight into underlying syntactic representations and the mechanisms that support language learning (Pickering & Ferreira, 2008). We employ a dialogue syntactic priming paradigm in which the participant and the experimenter alternate describing pictures of transitive verb events. The experimenter describes their prime picture according to a script (active vs. passive), but the participant can describe their picture however they wish – this constitutes the target response (see Figure 1). We manipulate whether the prime and the target contain the same or different verbs in order to investigate both lexically-independent (i.e. abstract) priming and lexically-dependent priming. We also manipulate the lag (i.e. intervening trials) between the prime and target (0-lag vs. 4-lag) in order to investigate short- and long-term syntactic priming. We have pre-registered the study on the Open Science Framework and data collection is currently ongoing.



We will recruit 60 participants from each of the following five groups: L1 English adults; L1 English 3-4-year-olds; L1 English 7-9-year-olds; Low proficient L2 English adults; High proficient L2 English adults. Comparing child language learners and L2 adult learners provides a unique insight into the universal features of language development across different groups. According to the implicit learning model (Chang et al., 2006), the magnitude of abstract priming will be highest in the younger children (3-4-year-olds) and low proficient L2 adults because rates of error-based learning are highest at the earliest stages of language development. By contrast, if initial syntax learning is lexically-specific (Hartsuiker & Bernolet, 2017; Tomasello, 2003), then we would not expect young children or low proficient L2 adults to display abstract priming as they have not yet developed fully generalisable abstract syntactic representations. Lexically-specific accounts of syntax acquisition do though predict that lexically-dependent priming should be observable right from the start of language learning. Alternatively, in the implicit learning model, lexically-dependent priming is driven by explicit memory of the prime (Chang et al., 2006); as such it should increase with a speaker’s age and cognitive ability, independent of language proficiency, meaning that low proficient L2 adults, but not young children, should show lexically-dependent priming. Experimentally investigating these predictions will contribute towards the development of a more parsimonious model of language learning that can explain syntax acquisition in a diverse range of speakers.
