The literature on vocal development has largely focused on the effects of social interaction to support the emergence of language. Gesture is also widely studied in infant and child development with an emphasis on how gesture supports language learning. There is a growing literature base highlighting the role of intrinsic motivation for endogenous activity in early infancy. To our knowledge, there has been no previous quantification of the social and endogenous nature of infant “protophones,” i.e., prelinguistic speech-like vocalizations, and gestures across the first year of life. This presentation presents the results from two studies quantifying the nature of vocal and gestural activity in the first year.

For Study 1, six parent-infant dyads (3 M, 3 F) completed two naturalistic laboratory recordings at 3, 6, and 10 months of age. From these recordings, infant protophones were labeled for a range of communicative and non-social functions, later collapsed into social or endogenous categories for data analysis. We found infants used significantly more endogenous vocalizations at all three ages, approximately 75% overall, compared to socially-directed ones (p < .001) as shown in Figure 1. Social and endogenous vocal activity also remained relatively stable across the three ages studied. For Study 2, we sought to investigate the directivity and rates of vocal communication compared to gestural communication. Ten parent-infant pairs (5 M, 5 F) were observed at ages 3, 6, and 11 months of age with their primary caregivers during interactive play sessions. For directivity, the infant protophones and gestures were labeled for social and non-social functions using the infant’s gaze direction as an indicator of intent. Figure 2 illustrates that the protophones were directed by gaze toward a person 74% more often that gestures (p < .001). However, both protophones and gestures were directed by gaze toward a person far less than half the time. The rate of occurrence between gestures and protophones was vastly different. Gestures occurred at an average of 2 per minute or less across the three ages, whereas protophones occurred at an average of approximately 6 per minute. 

Overall, infants used about three times as many endogenous protophones as social ones, a pattern that remained stable across the three ages. The results potentially suggest a larger role for intrinsic motivation to vocalize independent of face-to-face engagement than previously expected. The endogenous nature of infant communication applied whether the communication was vocal or gestural. Since gesture is inherently visual, it requires the recipient to be looking--yet the gesturing babies relatively rarely looked to see if the potential recipient was looking at them. Furthermore, the results from Study 2 showed that protophones occurred at almost three times the rate of gesture across the first year. Our results dramatically contradict the assumption that gesture is predominant in early infant communication, and thus suggest that gesture is not the primary foundation of language. On the contrary, the results are consistent with the suggestion that vocalization is, and always has, formed a more important foundation for language than gesture. We propose that high rates of endogenous vocalizations may have a deeply significant role in child language development, specifically for sensorimotor exploration and as the raw material with which parents engage.
