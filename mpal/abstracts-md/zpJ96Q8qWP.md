### The nature and frequency of relative clauses in the language children hear and the language children read: a developmental cross-corpus analysis of English complex grammar

Written language is lexically more diverse than speech. Child-directed text contains more unique words than child-directed speech (Montag et al., 2015). Few studies have examined grammar in the language children hear and read. In the current study, we compared the distributional frequency of a canonical complex grammatical structure – relative clauses – in three developmental corpora: (1) child-directed speech (CHILDES UK, speech directed to children age 0-5, 3.8 million words), (2) child-directed text (160 picture books for shared reading with children age 0-5, 310,000 words) and (3) text for independent reading (Oxford Children’s Corpus, texts from books, magazines, websites targeted at children age 5-16,  34 million words). 



The goal of the study is to understand relative clause usage in the spoken and written registers. We also examined the corpora developmentally - two corpora representing language exposure pre-literacy and one representing text exposure as children’s literacy skills are developing. We predicted that relative clauses would be more frequent in written language than in speech, and that relative clauses usage would increase as the intended age increased. 



Due to the large size of the corpora, we used automatic parser instead of hand coding to identify relative clauses. A high-accuracy parser Berkeley Neural Parser (Kitaev & Klein, 2018) was used to parse all sentences in the corpora, and the pattern extraction software Tregex (Levy & Andrew, 2006) was used to extract relative clauses. Three types of relative clauses were of interest: subject relative clauses (e.g. “the boy who jumped”, “the boy who kissed the girl”), object relative clauses (e.g. “the girl that the boy kissed”, “the crayon that you drew with”), and passive relative clauses (e.g. “the girl who was kissed by the boy”).  



Because of differing corpus sizes, the frequency of the three types of relative clauses was normalised by the number of noun phrases in each corpus (because relative clauses can only modify nouns). The results were plotted in Figure 1. All types of relative clauses were less frequent in child-directed speech than in either sample of written language. The contrast between picture books and child-directed speech is informative as both contain language targeted primarily at pre-schoolers. Even when the age of the child is comparable, there were more relative clauses in book language than spoken language. Across the two types of book language, picture books contained fewer relative clauses than books written for children to read themselves. Averaging across all three corpora, object relatives were most frequent with a mean 4.33 occurrences per 1000 noun phrases. Subject relative clauses were slightly less frequent (mean = 3.77) and passive relative clauses were least frequent (mean = 2.66). 



It can be seen that the distributional patterns of the three types of relative clauses are similar between the two younger corpora – child-directed speech and child-directed text, with object relatives being the most frequent and passive relatives the least frequent. The pattern changed for the corpus of text for independent reading, with subject relatives being the most frequent and passive relatives remaining the rarest. These patterns suggest that subject relatives are the most characteristic of the language written for children to read, and that passive relatives were uncommon across children’s language exposure in both speech and text. 



The results confirmed our predictions of written language being more grammatically complex than child-directed speech. Grammatical complexity increases as the targeted age increases. The types of relative clauses characteristic of written language that children read independently are distributionally different from what preschool children hear. Further analysis on genre and lexical-syntactic pairing will also be discussed.
