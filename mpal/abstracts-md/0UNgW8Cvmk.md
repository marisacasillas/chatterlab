### Mother-baby interactions: prosody variations according to maternal depression and infant age.

We aimed to study the prosodic characteristics of maternal IDS and their babies babbling through voice’s prosodic characteristics such as intensity, fundamental frequency (F0), melodic contours (intonation) and amount of utterances and its duration. PRAAT software were used to measure the acoustic properties of the voice signal in a sample of Spanish speaking mother-infant dyads -from Córdoba, Argentina- in relation to the presence or absence of signs of postpartum depression (PPD) and infants age (younger than 6 months or older than 6 months). The hypothesis has been that both the verbal production and the prosodic characteristics of the mother-baby dyads vary depending on the presence of signs of postpartum depression and child age.

44 mother-child dyads between 2 and 10 months of age were analyzed. They were recruited when attended to healthy child control and / or vaccination at the University Hospital of Maternity and Neonatology, a public hospital dependent on the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the National University of Córdoba. The mothers were primiarous, of legal age, born and raised in the city of Córdoba. Those dyads with congenital pathologies or diseases that could affect the assessment of the variables under consideration were excluded. All mothers expressed consent for their participation and that of their children in the study.

The mothers were given a postpartum depression screening questionnaire and the dyads participated in semi-structured play session where acoustic data were obtained.  

Factorial ANOVAs were performed for each variable related to verbal production and prosody for each member of the dyad depending on the factors PPD (with/without indicators of symptomatology) and infant age (2-6 months old group/7-10 months old group).

The results showed statistical significance in relation to PPD for the amount of infant utterances, maternal voice intensity and the use of falling contour intonation in mothers. Significant differences were also found as a function of infant’s age for the amount and duration of maternal vocalizations, intensity measurements and melodic curves in both members of the dyads. 

These findings showed that IDS used in mothers with PPD loses the melodic qualities of this particular speech modality that, according to literature, fulfill numerous functions during language acquisition. Also, the results indicate that in Argentinian Spanish speaking mother-infant dyads the acoustic and verbal production from IDS speech and babbling are moderated is moderated bay child´s age like is shown in studies from other languages.

The results are discussed in relation to those guidelines of the interactionist theories of language acquisition that relate the quality of the early link in the first months of children's life with their environment and its incidence on prelinguistic development and subjective construction.

Furthermore, the results could lead us to a diagnosis method that facilitates the detection of maladjustments during mother-infant communicative interactions based on prosodic and verbal production objective patterns.
