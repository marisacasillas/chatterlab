### Sign advantage in development of spatial language: Signing children’s spatial expressions are more informative than speaking children’s speech and gestures combined

Children often produce under-informative descriptions (Grigoroglou & Papafragou, 2019) such as in encoding space. Informative expressions for Left-Right are acquired later than other spatial relations (e.g., In). Speaking children instead use under-informative expressions (e.g., Side) to encode Left-Right. Signing children however are found to produce informative expressions for Left-Right in Turkish-Sign-Language [TİD] more than their Turkish-speaking peers around age 8 (Sümer, 2015). Perhaps, signing children, unlike speaking children, benefit from iconic linguistic structures that provide information about spatial relations in an analogue way via specific handshapes for objects’ shape and simultaneous hand placements to locate objects onto signing space. Yet, previous research has not ruled out the possibility that speaking children may also benefit from iconic gestures to informatively encode Left-Right. Here, we investigate whether acquisition of sign has an adv! antage ov er spoken language even when sign is compared to speech-plus-gesture for children and adults.



We elicited descriptions from 26 child (MAge = 8) and 25 adult (MAge = 35) monolingual-Turkish-speakers and 26 child (MAge = 8) and 25 adult (MAge = 29) TİD-signers. Stimuli were 84 displays with 4 pictures showing the same Ground (i.e., big) and Figure (i.e., small) objects in various spatial configurations (Left, Right, Front, Behind, In, On). Participants described target pictures (Left-Right; N = 28) to a confederate. 



We coded descriptions in terms of informativeness in speech, speech-plus-gesture, and sign. For speech, informative-descriptions included Left-Right spatial nouns. Under-informative-descriptions included a general relational noun (i.e., Side), incorrect (e.g., Front), or no spatial encoding (e.g., labeling objects only). Also, we coded spontaneous spatial co-speech gestures (e.g., expressing relative locations of only one or both objects via hand placements) that conveyed information missing in under-informative speech (Figure 1) and resulted in informative-descriptions multimodally. For sign, informative-descriptions included iconic linguistic strategies to encode Left-Right relations (Figure 2) and under-informative-descriptions included incorrect (e.g., Front) or no spatial encoding (e.g., labeling objects only). 



Speaking children disambiguated their under-informative-descriptions (Speech-only: 32%) via iconic gestures (Speech-plus-gesture: 77%) more than speaking adults (Speech-only: 86%; Speech-plus-gesture: 94%; β = 2.94, SE = 0.70, p < 0.001). Sign to speech-plus-gesture comparisons showed that signing children were more informative than speaking children (β = 1.78, SE = 0.54, p < 0.001) but speaking adults were equally informative to signing adults (β = 0.74, SE = 0.46, p = 0.105). Lastly, both signing and speaking children were less informative than their adults (Sign: β = 2.59, SE = 0.49, p < 0.001; Speech-only: β = 6.32, SE = 1.34, p < 0.001; Speech-plus-gesture: β = 1.73, SE = 0.52, p < 0.001). 



In brief, visual modality has a stronger impact on signing children than speaking children even when both speech and gestures are considered. This can be attributed to the variations in iconic structures in sign vs iconic co-speech gestures. Having iconic linguistic structures in sign languages, unlike gestures that are not learned as linguistic structures but rather only as part of a composite system with speech (Perniss, Özyürek & Morgan, 2017), might have facilitated the development of informativeness in Left-Right expressions for signing children more than speaking children. Interestingly, the facilitating impact of sign over speech-plus-gesture was not present in adults, suggesting sign advantage appears mostly in the development. Lastly, both signing and speaking children were less informative than adults pointing to the challenge of spatial domain in conceptual development (Clark E., 1973).
