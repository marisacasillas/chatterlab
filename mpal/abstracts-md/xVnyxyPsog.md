### Child-directed speech of multiple socializes in Mayan Tsotsil acquisition: A qualitative and interactional look

Research on input and child-directed speech [hereafter CDS] has been strongly biased toward dyadic mother-child interaction. Language socialization studies have long argued that the communicative environments of children show cultural variation and that, in many cultures, CDS is low in frequency and may be distributed among multiple caregivers (de León 2012; Ochs & Schieffelin 1984). Recent cross-cultural studies in language acquisition provide statistical evidence on the low frequency of direct input to infants in several nonindustrial societies; they argue that, the low rate notwithstanding, children show no language developmental delays (Shneidman & Goldin-Meadow 2012). However, given its statistical orientations, these studies normally consider decontextualized linguistic items while neglecting the real-time interactions that originally mediated the data. As a result, we know very little of the interactional dimensions of CDS in such cultural contexts.

The present study aims to address this gap by providing a linguistic anthropological analysis of CDS in Tsotsil Mayan. As in many nonindustrial societies, CDS in Tsotsil has a significantly lower rate compared to Western middle-class input reports (see Casillas, Brown and Levinson 2019 for Tseltal, neighbouring language). However, I will document here how Tsotsil infants are immersed in a variety of interactions distributed across multiple caregivers. Among adult caregivers we find a collection of interactional routines (e.g., rhetorical questions, prompting, teasing, and directives) that normally occur in triadic and other multiparty interactions (de León 2012). Sibling socializers also engage with young charges in play and care interactions some of which highlight structural properties of the language. Both adult and sibling CDS provide variation sets with morphological and lexical substitutions as well as repetition and rephrasing (Küntay and Slobin 2002).

In contrast to the conventional definition of input, which constructs the infant as a receptive vessel of language, an interactional approach to CDS reveals children’s emerging skills as semiotic agents who co-construct action and meaning with others. I argue here for including a broader spectrum of sources of input coming from multiple socializers to gain a more complete picture of communicative environments of children in nonindustrial cultures. To fully appreciate the richness of this process, we must consider the qualitative dimensions of CDS anchored in natural, everyday interactions.

The study is rooted in over three decades of anthropological and linguistic research in Zinacantán, Chiapas, México. It is part of larger longitudinal research on language acquisition and socialization of four children from 1 to 4 years old (de León 2012) and five supplementary children. For the present study, I focus on two focal children (a girl and a boy) of the same extended family. For the first child I look at a sample of data of interactional routines at 11 months old. For the second child I analyze twenty events of sibling play and care from 1;7 to 2;7 years old.
