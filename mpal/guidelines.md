# Preparing a video-recorded presentation

### General guidelines and quality control:
* Check and follow the guidelines below that are suitable for the presentation you are giving.
* We encourage you to record your presentation with a video image of your face, but this is not obligatory (pet cameos are always welcome).
* Make sure all your phone and email notifications are turned off before giving your presentation.
* Ensure that your recording environment is as quiet as possible before getting started. Consider sitting in a room with minimal echoing.
* If you will be playing any audio or video during your presentation, make sure to adjust the volume as needed before starting to record. 
* If you are using an external microphone (i.e., a microphone that is not built into your laptop), make sure that it is not too close to your mouth to avoid clicks and noise. 
* Make a short recording to test your sound quality and adjust your settings as needed:
    + Listen to the audio: 
        + Is it loud enough to clearly understand in a low-medium volume setting? 
        + Is the signal clear? 
        + Is there noticeable background noise?
    + Check the lighting and other visual components of your test presentation: 
        + Is the image of your face (if applicable) clear to see? 
        + Are your figures and text visible? 
        + Do your slide transitions work as expected?
* We will add captions to all presentations and will add interpreting to all talks. Make sure that your slides reserve space appropriately (examples: [wide format](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Jr6ilTatJygow1E9wDjFI_IXo_fti7KyQrOrEBgLXnE/edit?usp=sharing), [standard format](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b5Kl5AUfMQgRpt1Yt3NRnR6M4A6l4QF6intONEsRZoA/edit?usp=sharing))
* Stay within the allowed maximum duration for your presentation; otherwise, we will return it to you for re-recording.
* Send us your presentation as an **MP4** file.
* Label your video with the abstract number only; e.g. for abstract number 25, use the following: 25.MP4 
* Submit your video file and other supplementary materials (if applicable) via email to **mpal@mpi.nl**, no later than **October 5th**. You can send the files as email attachments or, if needed, as links to a place where we can download them (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.). 

### Preparing for Poster presentations:
* Your recorded Poster presentation should be no longer than **5 minutes**. We encourage you to aim for 3 minutes or less.
    + Poster presentations longer than 5 minutes will be returned for re-recording.
* You are welcome to present your poster as either a series of short slides or as a single slide (like a real-life poster) - as you wish.
* Your poster is part of a "theme" group (check the [handbook](https://marisacasillas.github.io/chatterlab/MPaL_handbook.html)). Each presenter in your theme group will receive a link to a Zoom room in which they can have discussions, and break off to separate rooms if contacted individually by a viewer during the poster presentation sessions. This Zoom link will be available on the website for each theme group in case you also want to visit other themes.
* There will be a "guestbook" for each poster where people can indicate that they have seen your poster and send you any comments/questions they have.
* Together with your presentation video, you may also send us a pdf version of your poster for visitors to download.
* Follow the general guidelines above.
* Please note that your poster presentation will be available for viewing outside of the workshop hours.

### Preparing for Flash poster presentations:
* You will prepare a regular poster presentation (see above) and ALSO a Flash poster presentation, described here.
* Your recorded Flash poster presentation should be no longer than **2 minutes**.
    + Flash poster presentations longer than 2 minutes will be returned for re-recording.
* This mini presentation should provide a very brief and intriguing introduction to your work in order to attract attendees to your full poster presentation.
* Follow the general guidelines above.
* Please note that your flash poster presentation will be available for viewing outside of the workshop hours.

### Preparing for Talks:
* Each talk will be allocated **15 minutes**. Live Q&A will take place in the 15 minutes at the end of each talk session (i.e., after three consecutive talks); questions may be directed to any subset of the presenters.
* Your recorded talk should be no longer than **15 minutes**.
    + Talk recordings longer than 15 minutes will be returned for re-recording
* Follow the general guidelines above.
* Live Q&A:
    + Live Q&A will be conducted as a Zoom Webinar; as a presenter, you will be a "Panelist" in the webinar. This means that your voice and image will be live-streamed, along with those of your fellow panelists and the session moderator. You will not see the chat or video images of attendees.
    + You will have a moderator in your session who collects all the incoming questions and asks them of the presenters during the Q&A portion.
    + You are not expected to be available for live Q&A during all timezones. If you haven't already, please indicate your availability for live Q&A in the following [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LEDuewgSRLjWs4g5tP513nsuDxEhGxrWUMn9FMr7FmM/edit).
    + If someone has a question for you during a time when you are not available to give a live answer, we will forward the question to you afterwards.
    + The live session will not be recorded.
* Please note that your talk will be available for viewing outside of the workshop hours.
