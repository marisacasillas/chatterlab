About Broadly speaking, I am interested in exploring how cognitive and social processes shape the ways in which we learn, perceive, and produce language. My primary research examines the relationship between communicative skills and linguistic processing in children and adults. I use a combination of experimental- and observation-based methods to comparatively investigate these processes in both urban, Western contexts and rural, Indigenous contexts.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/marye-aboutme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/marye-aboutme/</guid><description>Mary Elliott (she/her/hers) About me I am a speech language pathology masters student at the University of Texas at Dallas.

This course tackles the basic skills needed to build an integrated research report with the R programming language. We will cover every step from data to manuscript including: Using R&amp;rsquo;s libraries to clean up and re-format messy datasets, preparing data sets for analysis, running statistical tools, generating clear and attractive figures and tables, and knitting those bits of code together with your manuscript writing.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/d2m2022/course_instructions/instructions-data_selection_guidelines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/d2m2022/course_instructions/instructions-data_selection_guidelines/</guid><description>Data selection guidelines You must have a dataset to work with over the course of this quarter.

Language may be learned by individuals, but we most often use it for communication between groups. How is it that we manage to transmit our internal thoughts to others&amp;rsquo; minds? How is it that we can understand what others mean to express to us? Whether we are greeting a passerby, ordering a meal, or debating politics, there are a number of invisible processes that bring language to life in the space between individuals.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/hli2022/miniassignment1-rubric/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/hli2022/miniassignment1-rubric/</guid><description>Mini assignment 1 rubric [main page]

Instructor: Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)
Weekly assignments Wednesdays: Question and synopsis due before midnight Chicago time Thursdays in class: 1-question reading comprehension quiz Assignment descriptions Question and synopsis Post to Canvas discussion board (in this order):
A succinctly stated question directly derived from the week’s readings and lecture (two-three sentences at most). This should be a question that emerges from having understood the claims presented in the readings and/or lecture, not just a general question that one could ask of the topic without having read the material or heard the lecture.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/mind3-2022/course_instructions/final-paper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/mind3-2022/course_instructions/final-paper/</guid><description>Final paper Due dates Topic proposal: 11:59pm Tuesday, May 17 (via Canvas) Full final paper: 11:59pm Tuesday, May 31 (via Canvas) Instructions Overview Your final paper should be a coherent literature review of a specific topic that relates to the concepts covered this quarter. The paper should cover both current theories and empirical research relating to your topic. Thematically, your paper should build strong connections between your chosen topic and the broader themes of how context shapes psychological functions and processes.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/mind3-2022/course_instructions/wk1-synopsis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/mind3-2022/course_instructions/wk1-synopsis/</guid><description>Week 1 synopsis After reading and analyzing each of this week’s assigned articles by applying the methods outlined in the handout Guidelines for Mind (see Files/Guidelines for Mind (HenlyFallQ).pdf on Canvas), write a synopsis of one of them. Your synopsis should succinctly address the following questions (you should be able to answer most of these questions using 1 sentence or even bullet points, #4 and #5 may take a little more explanation).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/mind3-2022/course_instructions/wk2to9-synopsis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/mind3-2022/course_instructions/wk2to9-synopsis/</guid><description>Weeks 2–9 synopsis You will need to find and read an empirical article related to the week’s topic to present during our discussion. The goal of this assignment is to give you some experience 1) generating theoretical implications and hypotheses based on the readings and lectures, 2) searching the scientific literature to find empirical studies that bear on these hypotheses, and 3) presenting that research in a succinct yet comprehensible manner to an audience that is entirely unfamiliar with it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/former-members/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/former-members/</guid><description>Former members Aditya Badlani

Before coming to Chicago, she completed her BA (UCLA) and PhD (Stanford University) in Linguistics, followed by postdoctoral work at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands. Her research draws on linguistics, psychology, and conversation analysis to investigate the foundations of human language cognition. She conducts observational and experimental work on adult and child language behavior in American English, Dutch, Tseltal (Mayan), and Yélî Dnye (isolate; Papua New Guinea), but maintains active collaborations with researchers working on other languages, including Sign Language of the Netherlands and Tsimane&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/positions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/positions/</guid><description>come join us! PhD students If you are interested in applying for a PhD in Comparative Human Development to work with Dr. Casillas, please get in touch with her. Include a CV and a brief description of what your mutual interests are and what you would like to know more about regarding the program and work in the lab.
Interns and research assistantships The chatter lab offers a small number of paid internships for undergraduate students who want to get short-term (3 month) hands-on experience with an existing lab project.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/projects/</guid><description>chatter lab projects and methods As an interdisciplinary lab, we work on a rather diverse array of topics using an even broader set of methodological approaches. We give a short introduction here to three of these research topics, giving some examples of methods for each:
Language development across cultural contexts
Real-time language use in interaction
Multimodal conversational coordination
Language development across cultural contexts We conduct quantitative investigations into the early language environments and language development of children growing up in a variety of cultural and linguistic contexts.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/publications/</guid><description>chatter publications [ms] = manuscript, [sm] = supplementary materials, [gh]/[osf] = associated repository
