# Human language and interaction

Spring 2022: CHDV 23100, LING 21150, PSYC 23120, EDSO 23101

Tuesdays and Thursdays 9:30am-10:50am Chicago time

Office hours: Tuesdays 1:00–2:00pm, or by appointment.

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

Language may be learned by individuals, but we most often use it for communication between groups. How is it that we manage to transmit our internal thoughts to others' minds? How is it that we can understand what others mean to express to us? Whether we are greeting a passerby, ordering a meal, or debating politics, there are a number of invisible processes that bring language to life in the space between individuals. This course investigates the social and cognitive processes that enable us to successfully communicate with others. The theories we cover are built on observations of adult language use and child development in multiple cultural settings, taking inspiration also from non-human animal communication.

It is expected that, by the end of the course, students will be able to explain the limitations of language for communication and will be able to elaborate on a number of social and other cognitive processes that critically support communicative language use.
 
**Course materials:**

* Most required readings will be drawn from Herbert H. Clark's text [Using Language](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/using-language/4E7EBC4EC742C26436F6CF187C43F239).
* The other required readings include a few separate chapters/articles on:
	* [Human Interaction Engine](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3171367_3/component/file_3186123/content)
	* [Conversation Analysis](https://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-40)
	* [Sequence organization](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zs74jwrloxb15g2/stivers2013sequence.pdf?dl=0)
	* [Multimodal interaction](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2352807_13/component/file_2459489/content)
	* the experiment we will try to replicate as a class, by [Schober and Clark (1989)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nlhgqs61wv387dv/SchoberClark1989.pdf?dl=0)

All other course materials will be available online on Canvas and the ChatterLab course webpage.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:


| Component | Undergraduates |
|-----------|----------------|
| Mini papers | 60% |
| Participation | 10% |
| Scientific report | 30% |


### Mini papers

Over the course of the quarter, students will submit four mini papers (up to 15% each). Mini papers typically engage with real data of some kind. Papers will be evaluated based on their (a) thoroughness and attention to detail with respect to the data/prompt, and (b) quality of discussion relating the data to course materials. Personal anecdotes, broad questions, and critiques not accompanied by constructive commentary will **not** count as sufficient discussion topics.


### Participation

Students are generally expected to come to class and actively participate in discussion. The participation grade reflects the range from no attendance (0%) to near-full attendance and active participation at every session attended (10%). Please stay in touch with Marisa about your limitations regarding in-person participation. 

### Scientific report (4000 words *max*)

We will try and replicate the classic studies reported in [Schober & Clark's (1989) paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nlhgqs61wv387dv/SchoberClark1989.pdf?dl=0). Your final assignment will be to submit a scientific report of our class findings that also proposes and motivates an original, but incremental followup study. Our last lecture will be dedicated to learning the basics of scientific report writing and you will receive a grading rubric at that session.
