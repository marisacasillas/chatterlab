# Human language and interaction

Spring 2022: CHDV 23100

Tuesdays and Thursdays 11:00am-12:20pm Chicago time

Office hours: TBA, or by appointment.

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

Language may be learned by individuals, but we most often use it for communication between groups. How is it that we manage to transmit our internal thoughts to others' minds? How is it that we can understand what others mean to express to us? Whether we are greeting a passerby, ordering a meal, or debating politics, there are a number of invisible processes that bring language to life in the space between individuals. This course investigates the social and cognitive processes that enable us to successfully communicate with others. The theories we cover are built on observations of adult language use and child development in multiple cultural settings, taking inspiration also from non-human animal communication.

It is expected that, by the end of the course, students will be able to explain the limitations of language for communication and will be able to elaborate on a number of social and other cognitive processes that critically support communicative language use.
 
**Course materials:**

* Most required readings will be drawn from Herbert H. Clark's text [Using Language](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/using-language/4E7EBC4EC742C26436F6CF187C43F239).
* The other required readings include a few separate chapters/articles on:
	* [Human Interaction Engine](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3171367_3/component/file_3186123/content)
	* [Conversation Analysis](https://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-40)
	* [Sequence organization](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zs74jwrloxb15g2/stivers2013sequence.pdf?dl=0)
	* [Multimodal interaction](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3071921_4/component/file_3150894/content)
	* the experiment we will try to replicate as a class, by [Schober and Clark (1989)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nlhgqs61wv387dv/SchoberClark1989.pdf?dl=0)

All other course materials will be available online on Canvas and the ChatterLab course webpage.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:


| Component | Undergraduates |
|-----------|----------------|
| Mini assignments | 60% |
| Participation | 10% |
| Scientific report | 30% |


### Mini assignments

There are short assignments related to the readings. There is a mini assignment for each lecture, with a few exceptions (16 assignments in total). These are all short assignments that should take no more than 2 hours (most should take ~1 hour or less).

### Participation

Students are generally expected to come to class and actively participate in discussion. That said, please stay in touch with Marisa about your limitations regarding in-person participation. Students can earn participation credit using some combination of active attendance in class and discussion of course content in office hours. **Each student must come to office hours at least one time for full participation credit.**

### Scientific report (2500 words max)

We will try and replicate the classic studies reported in [Schober & Clark's (1989) paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nlhgqs61wv387dv/SchoberClark1989.pdf?dl=0). Your final assignment will be to submit a scientific report of our class findings. Our last lecture will be dedicated to learning the basics of scientific report writing and you will receive a grading rubric at that session.
