This course tackles the basic skills needed to build an integrated research report with the R programming language. We will cover every step from data to manuscript including: Using R&amp;rsquo;s libraries to clean up and re-format messy datasets, preparing data sets for analysis, running statistical tools, generating clear and attractive figures and tables, and knitting those bits of code together with your manuscript writing.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/d2m2022/course_instructions/instructions-data_selection_guidelines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/d2m2022/course_instructions/instructions-data_selection_guidelines/</guid><description>Data selection guidelines You must have a dataset to work with over the course of this quarter. It should ideally be a dataset that is urgently important to you and that you want to write up into a scientific report now/soon. Those in this &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; situation are certain to get the most out of this course.
What constitutes an appropriate, ready dataset is hard to comprehensively define. But here are a few core features that the dataset should have for the purposes of this course (and for quantitative/automated analysis and open, replicable science in general, though not strictly):</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/casillas-devcommcomp-winter2022-syllabus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/casillas-devcommcomp-winter2022-syllabus/</guid><description>The development of communicative competence Winter 2022: CHDV 38950, PSYC 38960, LING 38951, EDSO 38950

This course examines the emergence of communicative skills in humans. We will discuss the proposed cognitive, developmental, and evolutionary roots of communicative behaviors, with a focus on current gaps in our knowledge and possible pathways forward.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/instructions-debate_participation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/instructions-debate_participation/</guid><description>Grading guidelines: Debate/&amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; presentation participation Group debate: Turn-taking behaviors are universal to communicative systems There is one in-class debate planned in this course, and you will receive up to 1 point for your contribution.
In this debate, we will split up into groups and have a debate with one group arguing for the prompt and one group arguing against it. Groups will have a chance to work together to build their arguments and their response to the other group&amp;rsquo;s arguments.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/participation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/participation/</guid><description>Grading guidelines: Active attendance The Winter 2022 quarter gives us 18 class sessions together (Tuesdays and Thursdays for nine weeks). Students receive 1 point for each time they actively attend a class. The last 2 points for participation come from contributions to the two class debate and turn-taking feature presentations.
Active attendance at class sessions I will ask myself the following questions after each class session. If the answers are &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; to both, the student receives 1 point.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/reading_notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/reading_notes/</guid><description>Grading guidelines: Reading notes This course has a total of 36 assigned readings, but notes are only required for 30 of them. Students are allowed to pick which 30 readings to submit notes for. Each reading notes submission is worth 1.5 points (max 45 points). Of course students are welcome to take notes on all 36 readings, if desired ;)
Just in case you missed it, reading notes are 45% of your grade in this course!</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/research_proposal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/research_proposal/</guid><description>Grading guidelines: Research proposal The research proposal makes up 20% of your overall grade, including up to 2% for your class presentation of the proposal and up to 18% for your full written proposal that is due during finals week. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that either link to their other areas of expertise or their favorite topics introduced during the course.
Flash presentation of the proposed research Students will present the basic idea of their research proposal to their fellow classmates.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/transcription_mini_project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/transcription_mini_project/</guid><description>Grading guidelines: Transcription mini project Transcription mini projects have three sub-parts, as follows: (1) Annotation and reflection submission, (2) proposal of mini research question, and (3) flash presentation of findings.
Annotation and reflection submission You will be asked to submit new annotations on your converation clips four times during this course. Each time you submit annotations, you should also submit a short paragraph reflecting on your experience. Each of the four submissions are worth up to three points.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/hli2022/casillas-hli-spring2022-syllabus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/hli2022/casillas-hli-spring2022-syllabus/</guid><description>Human language and interaction Spring 2022: CHDV 23100, LING 21150, PSYC 23120, EDSO 23101

Language may be learned by individuals, but we most often use it for communication between groups. How is it that we manage to transmit our internal thoughts to others&amp;rsquo; minds? How is it that we can understand what others mean to express to us? Whether we are greeting a passerby, ordering a meal, or debating politics, there are a number of invisible processes that bring language to life in the space between individuals.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/hli2022/miniassignment1-rubric/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/hli2022/miniassignment1-rubric/</guid><description>Mini assignment 1 rubric Assignment evaluation questions In assessing submissions for mini assignment 1, the grader will ask themselves the following questions, answering each on the scale of:
0 = grossly incomplete/not addressed
1 = needs significant work
2 = minimally fulfills requirements
3 = good effort, but with room for improvement
4 = excellent and above expectations
A. Is the example thoughtfully selected?: The joint activity selected by the student should be a clear case of a joint activity that is highly distinct from the (many) examples presented in the readings, lectures, and questions that came up during lecture.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/hli2022/miniassignment2-rubric/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/hli2022/miniassignment2-rubric/</guid><description>Mini assignment 2 rubric Assignment evaluation questions In assessing submissions for mini assignment 2, the grader will ask themselves the following questions, answering each on the scale of:

Weekly assignments Wednesdays: Question and synopsis due before midnight Chicago time Thursdays in class: 1-question reading comprehension quiz Assignment descriptions Question and synopsis Post to Canvas discussion board (in this order):
A succinctly stated question directly derived from the week’s readings and lecture (two-three sentences at most).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/mind3-2022/course_instructions/wk1-synopsis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/mind3-2022/course_instructions/wk1-synopsis/</guid><description>Week 1 synopsis After reading and analyzing each of this week’s assigned articles by applying the methods outlined in the handout Guidelines for Mind (see Files/Guidelines for Mind (HenlyFallQ).pdf on Canvas), write a synopsis of one of them. Your synopsis should succinctly address the following questions (you should be able to answer most of these questions using 1 sentence or even bullet points, #4 and #5 may take a little more explanation).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/mind3-2022/course_instructions/wk2to9-synopsis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/courses/mind3-2022/course_instructions/wk2to9-synopsis/</guid><description>Weeks 2–9 synopsis You will need to find and read an empirical article related to the week’s topic to present during our discussion. The goal of this assignment is to give you some experience 1) generating theoretical implications and hypotheses based on the readings and lectures, 2) searching the scientific literature to find empirical studies that bear on these hypotheses, and 3) presenting that research in a succinct yet comprehensible manner to an audience that is entirely unfamiliar with it.</description></item></channel></rss>
