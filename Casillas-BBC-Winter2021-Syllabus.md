# Blooming, Buzzing Confusion
## Making Sense of Language in the First Few Years of Life

Winter 2021: CHDV 23010

Tuesdays and Thursdays 12:30pm-1:50pm Chicago time

Office hours: Wednesdays 4:00pm–5:00pm Chicago time, or by appointment.

NOTE: This course is taking place **remotely**; email the instructor if you need access to the relevant meeting and coursework links.

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

This course examines the social and cognitive mechanisms that drive language learning in the first few years of life. Nearly all children learn the language(s) of their community, despite the fact that human languages and caregiving practices offer immense diversity around the globe. What enables the learning system to adapt so robustly to the environment it finds itself in? We discuss the evidence for and against multiple factors that have been proposed to support language development across the world’s communities. We also critically examine how these ideas intersect with current deficit models of language learning. 
It is expected that, by the end of the course, students will grasp the basic mechanisms proposed to underlie early language learning and will design a novel research project to test one of these mechanisms in infants or young children.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:


| Component | Undergraduates | Graduates |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| [Reading notes](./course-instructions/reading_notes.md) | 30% | 30% |
| [Participation](./course-instructions/participation.md) | 20% | 20% |
| [Mini essay exams](./course-instructions/mini_essay_exams.md) | 30% | - |
| [Squibs](./course-instructions/squibs.md) | - | 30% |
| [Methods presentations](./course-instructions/methods_presentations.md) | 20% | 20% |


### Reading notes

Students are expected to submit digital notes summarizing and reacting to a subset of the assigned readings. Marisa will evaluate each submission of reading notes according to a set rubric (see the [guidelines](./course-instructions/reading_notes.md) for details).

### Participation

Students are generally expected to come to class and actively participate in discussion. That said, please stay in touch with Marisa about your limitations regarding live participation. Details on participation points are [here](./course-instructions/participation.md), but in brief, students can earn participation credit using some combination of [active attendance in class](https://marisacasillas.github.io/chatterlab/course-instructions/participation#what-is-active-attendance) and [discussion of course content in office hours](https://marisacasillas.github.io/chatterlab/course-instructions/participation#how-should-i-prepare-for-office-hours-participation).

### Mini essay exams

Undergraduate students are expected to complete three mini essay exams: one in week 4, one in week 7, and one during finals week. For each exam, students will have one week to give two short (~500 word) responses to take-home prompts. The exam will be graded following a the instructions [here](./course-instructions/mini_essay_exams.md).

### Squibs

Graduate students are expected to submit six [squibs](./course-instructions/squibs.md) (i.e., very short theoretical papers) over the course of the quarter on topics of their choice related to course content.

### Methods presentations

Each student is expected to participate in a total of two methods presentations. Methods presentations are group projects. Groups will interview a researcher with expertise in the assigned method and then: (1) create a 20-minute pre-recorded mini lecture introducing and giving some demonstration of the assigned research method and (2) elicit and answer questions from the class (~10-15 minutes). Group members will also give a short evaluation of their and their peers' contributions to the project. Graduate students are expected to take a leadership role in their groups (see the [guidelines](./course-instructions/methods_presentations.md) for details).
