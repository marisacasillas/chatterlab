# Blooming, Buzzing Confusion
## Making Sense of Language in the First Few Years of Life

Winter 2021: CHDV 23010

Tuesdays and Thursdays 12:30pm-1:50pm Chicago time

Office hours: Wednesday and Friday 4:00pm–6:00pm Chicago time, or by appointment.

NOTE: This course is taking place **remotely**; email the instructor if you need access to the relevant meeting and coursework links.

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

This course examines the social and cognitive mechanisms that drive language learning in the first few years of life. Nearly all children learn the language(s) of their community, despite the fact that human languages and caregiving practices offer immense diversity around the globe. What enables the learning system to adapt so robustly to the environment it finds itself in? We discuss the evidence for and against multiple factors that have been proposed to support language development across the world’s communities. We also critically examine how these ideas intersect with current deficit models of language learning. 
It is expected that, by the end of the course, students will grasp the basic mechanisms proposed to underlie early language learning and will design a novel research project to test one of these mechanisms in infants or young children.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:


| Component | Undergraduates | Graduates |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Reading notes | 30% | 20% |
| Participation | 20% | 20% |
| Mini essay exams | 30% | - |
| Squibs | - | 30% |
| Methods presentation | 20% | 30% |


### Reading notes

Students are expected to submit digital notes summarizing and reacting to each assigned reading (~1/2 pages each). Marisa will evaluate each student's notes for each reading on a pass/fail basis (guidelines [here](./course-instructions/reading_notes.md)). There are a total of 36 required readings, but notes are only required for 30 of them (if you are an undergraduate) or for 20 of them (if you are a graduate), and students may pick which of the readings they would like to submit notes for (i.e., students earn 1% for each reading with satisfactory notes).

* 1 point for every [reading with notes](./course-instructions/reading_notes.md) _(max 30 points for undergraduate students and max20 points for graduate students)_

### Participation

Class discussion is an important component of this course. Students are generally expected to come to class and actively participate in discussion. That said, the unpredictability and multi-timezone nature of coursework this academic year may make it difficult for students to attend some classes, so **please stay in touch with Marisa about your limits regarding live participation**. Details on participation points are [here](./course-instructions/participation.md), but in brief, students can earn a maximum of 20 participation points (i.e. 20% of their total grade) using some combination of the following:

* 18 x 1 point for [active attendance at each class](https://marisacasillas.github.io/chatterlab/course-instructions/participation#what-is-active-attendance)
* 2 x 2 points for [an office hours discussion with Marisa](https://marisacasillas.github.io/chatterlab/course-instructions/participation#how-should-i-prepare-for-office-hours-participation) _(max 4 points)_


### Mini essay exams

Undergraduate students are expected to complete three mini essay exams: one in week 4, one in week 7, and one during finals week. For each exam, students will give two short (~500 word) responses to take-home prompts. The exam will be graded following a the instructions [here](./course-instructions/mini_essay_exams.md). Each response is worth 5% of the student's total grade (summing to 30% in total).

* 2 x 5 points for each response in the week 4 exam
* 2 x 5 points for each response in the week 7 exam
* 2 x 5 points for each response in the finals week exam

### Squibs

Graduate students are expected to submit six (~2500–3000 word) [squibs](./course-instructions/squibs.md) (i.e., short theoretical papers) over the course of the quarter (see schedule).

* 6 * 5 points for each squib

### Methods presentation

Each student (graduate and undergraduate) is expected to participate in a total of two methods presentations. Methods presentations include two components: (1) a 20-minute pre-recorded mini lecture introducing and giving some demonstration of a specific research method and (2) answering questions from the class about the method (~10 minutes). Each presentation will be prepared by a small group of students; the assignment of students to methods will take place at the beginning of the quarter. Graduate students are expected to take a leading role in their groups. More information about grading the methods presentations can be found [here](./course-instructions/methods_presentations.md).

Undergraduate students:

* 2 * 10 points for each presentation

Graduate students:

* 2 * 15 points for each presentation
