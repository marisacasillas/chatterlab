# Grading guidelines: Proposal for mini study of conversation clips

Before adding the annotation of their choice to the conversation clips, students should first give a brief description of what they want to add and why. This proposal for additional annotation should be 300–500 words.

Full credit for the proposal (3 points) will be given when:

1. the proposal is 300–500 words
2. the new annotations proposed are clearly defined
3. a specific research question is asked
4. it is clear how the new annotations can help answer the specific research question
5. at least one forseeable issue or question relating to the proposed analysis is raised

This proposal will be used as the basis for a one-on-one chat with Marisa about your mini study later in the week, so please turn them in by the beginning of class on **May 12th**.

## Late proposal?
Late proposals can be submitted within one week of the original due date with a 0.5 point penalty.
