# Grading guidelines: Reading notes

This course has a total of 36 required readings, but notes are only required for 30 of them. Students are allowed to pick which 30 readings to submit notes for. Each reading notes submission is worth 1 point (max 30 points). Of course students are welcome to take notes on all 36 readings, if desired ;)

Just in case you missed it, reading notes are 30% of your grade in this course!

Notes for required readings are due by the start of class. **Please have your notes accessible during class.**

## Why??
Don't notes seem a little... basic? Note taking is a fundamental skill, and I'm sure many of you have practiced it for many years. That said, I've observed many, _many_ people who do not take notes in circumstances where it would theoretically provide them significant benefit. Certainly the research on this topic strongly suggests that note taking supports deep (and efficient!) learning. Good note-taking skills are essential for many careers, including academic ones. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, it's also a great tool for supporting self-directed teaching and review, and gives me an opportunity to assess how well you're getting what you need from the readings!

**So** in this class we are getting into a note-taking habit.

## How will notes be evaluated?
For full credit (1 point) the notes for a reading must:

1. have a clear title with bibliographic information and date
2. fill at least one half page
3. contain sketches/simplified re-drawings of all key figures/findings
4. be spatially separated into at least three sections: e.g., detailed notes, overall summary, comments/questions
5. have few direct quotes; reformulate thoughts in your own words
6. mention at least one link to another paper covered in class
7. mention at least one link to the student's research interests

- Notes can be made in the language of your choice, but please make sure I can use Google Translate or similar to assess points 4â€“7 above
- Notes can be written in a text editor, by hand (submitted as a high-resolution image), or a blend of the two
- If you already have a technique for reading notes, please contact me to discuss

## Late reading notes?
Late notes can be submitted within a week of the original due date with a 0.5 point penalty.
