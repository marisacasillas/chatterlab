# Grading guidelines: Reading notes

This course has a total of 36 required readings, but notes are only required for 30 of them. Students are allowed to pick which 30 readings to submit notes for. Each reading notes submission is worth 1 point (max 30 points). Of course students are welcome to take notes on all 36 readings, if desired ;)

Just in case you missed it, reading notes are 30% of your grade in this course!

## Why??
Don't notes seem a little... basic? It's true that note-taking is a fundamental skill that many of you will have practiced for many years. That said, I've observed many, _many_ people who do not take notes in circumstances where it would theoretically provide them significant benefit. Certainly the research on this topic strongly suggests that note-taking supports deep (and efficient!) learning. Good note-taking skills are essential for many careers, including academia. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, it's also a great tool for supporting self-directed teaching and review. It also gives me an opportunity to assess how well you're getting what you need from the readings, which is helpful when we can't meet in person!

**So** in this class we are practicing getting into the note-taking habit.

## How will notes be graded?
For full credit (1 point) the notes for a reading must:

1. have a clear title with bibliographic information and date
2. contain at least 500 words
3. contain sketches of all key figures/findings
4. be spatially separated into at least three sections: title, detailed notes, summary, comments/questions
5. has minimal direct quotes; you should be reformulating notes in your own words
6. mentions at least one link to another paper covered in class
7. mentions at least one link to the student's research interests
8. Be submitted on time

- Notes can be made in the language of your choice, but please make sure I can use Google Translate or similar to assess points 4â€“7 above.
- Notes can be written in a text editor, by hand (submitted as a high-resolution image), or a blend of the two.
- If you already have a technique for reading notes, please contact me asap.

## When are reading notes due?
Notes for required readings are due by the start of class, and should be submitted on Canvas. Please have your notes accessible during class.

Late notes can be submitted within a week with a 0.5 point penalty.
