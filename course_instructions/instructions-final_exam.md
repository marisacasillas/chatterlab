# Final exam

This exam makes up 15% of your overall grade.

Please note: Marisa is happy to answer clarification questions about the prompts and grading rubrics but cannot provide any feedback about the specific content you plan to provide in your response.

## Short essay (up to 7 points)

Please respond to ONE of the two prompts below. Your response should be between 1500 and 2000 words (~3–4 pages) and include accurate, appropriate references to _at least_ six of the papers we read in the course.

### Prompt 1. What are the greatest challenges to the Interaction Engine Hypothesis given the scientific findings we have covered? What is the most important next step for building on this theory, and why?

### Prompt 2. Linguistic information is both fundamental and completely unnecessary for ordinary turn-driven interactional exchanges. Argue for the fundamental role of linguistic information in the first half of your response, and for the lack of a need for linguistic information in the second half.

### Grading
A top-scoring essay will:

- thoroughly and accurately cover the relevant literature that we have reviewed in the course (minimally six papers),
- refer to findings/phenomena from multiple cultural groups, language types, interactional settings, and/or methods,
- use clear and persuasive argumentation with at least two specific examples to support the arguments made,
- include original figures and/or tables
- draw independent and original conclusions synthesizing the relevant course content and class discussions, and
- be typo-free and easy to understand


## Science communication (up to 7 points)

Please produce a short video or audio presentation (your choice) introducing one of the following topics to the public. 

### Topics

* The evolution of turn-taking (human and non-human)
* (Potential) universals in human conversation
* The influence of visual signals in everyday conversation
* How children learn to take turns
* The role of prediction in human interaction

Your presentation should define the core phenomena for this topic, explain why the topic is important to know about, demonstrate how the most relevant measures are made (with _multiple_ concrete examples), discuss two of the most important findings, and mention at least one exciting future direction for research. The presentation should be around 10 minutes long---any shorter and you should probably be adding more content!

### Grading
A top-scoring presentation will:

- be scientifically accurate and thorough,
- include at least two appropriate and specific examples of relevant measures,
- accurately describe at least two important findings,
- convincingly argue for future research that would engage with deep questions still open on this topic,
- be written and delivered in an engaging manner,
- be clear enough so that the average adult who knows nothing about this topic can understand everything (I will be testing this!---this is a good chance to get feedback from your friends and family). 


## Course reflection (up to 1 point)

Please write one paragraph (200–500 words) describing a theory, finding, method, and/or experience you encountered in this course that has changed the way you look at human communication. What changed for you, and why?

### Grading
A top-scoring course refection will:

- mention a specific theory, finding, method, or experience,
- describe a change in thinking about human communication ("before" and "after"), and
- be thoughtful and clearly written.
