# Grading guidelines: Debate participation
There are two in-class debates planned in this course, and you will receive up to 1 point for your contributions to each.

## Group debate: Turn-taking behaviors are universal to communicative systems
In this debate, we will split up into groups and have a debate with one group arguing _for_ the prompt and one group arguing _against_ it. Groups will have a chance to work together to build their arguments and their response to the other group's arguments.

Full credit for participation in this debate (1 point) is gained by your contribution to at least one of the following activities:

- taking notes during brainstorming
- taking notes while listening to the other group's arguments
- fact-checking your group's arguments
- fact-checking the other group's arguments
- presenting one of your group's arguments

_NOTE:_ More than one person in each group can do each of these tasks, and it is up to the group to make sure that everyone is given the opportunity to make a significant contribution.

A panel of ~5 listeners will log in to listen to your arguments. They will vote on the prompt both before and after the debate. The team that sways the most votes in their favor wins a mystery prize.

## Speed debates (in pairs): The defining characteristic of human conversation is ________
For this debate, students will split up into pairs, each of which will be assigned to represent a particular researcher's point of view. On the debate day, pairs will meet each other and make their case. We will then discuss as a group how people's opinions changed over the course of the debate.

Students will have two in-class work sessions with their partner to develop their researcher "profile", which includes a summary of that researcher's research method and their big ideas relevant to human conversation.

An outline of this researcher profile is optionally due after the second in-class session (0 points). The completed researcher profile (0.5 points) is due by the start of class on the day of the speed debates, **April 30th**.

Participation in the speed debates is worth 0.5 points.

Full credit is therefore gained by submitting a researcher profile with the defined information above and by participation in the speed debates.

## Unable to participate in a debate?
If you are unable to participate in one of the debates, please let Marisa know as soon as possible. We can discuss the possibility of making up this credit on a case-by-case basis.
