# From Data to Manuscript in R

Winter 2022: CHDV 20550/30550, MACS 30550, MAPS 30550, PSYC 30550

Tuesdays and Thursdays 09.30-10.50 Chicago time

Office hours: Tuesdays 11.00â€“12.30 in Rosenwald 318A or by appointment

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

This course tackles the basic skills needed to build an integrated research report with the R programming language. We will cover every step from data to manuscript including: Using R's libraries to clean up and re-format messy datasets, preparing data sets for analysis, running statistical tools, generating clear and attractive figures and tables, and knitting those bits of code together with your manuscript writing. The result will be a reproducible, open-science friendly report that you can easily update after finishing data collection or receiving comments from readers. Never copy-paste your way through a table again! The R universe is large, so this course will focus specifically on: The core R libraries, the tidyverse library, and R Markdown. Students will also learn about the use of GitHub for version control.
 
**Course materials:**

* Most required readings will be drawn from one of the following great (and free! and online!) resources:
	* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham.
	* [R Markdown for Scientists](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/) by Nicholas Tierney
* Also check out [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund

Any other course materials will be available online on Canvas and the ChatterLab course webpage.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:


| Component | Undergraduates |
|-----------|----------------|
| Mini assignments | 60% |
| Participation | 20% |
| Scientific report | 20% |


### Mini assignments

There is a mini assignment for each lecture. Each assignment will involve working with your own data, data provided for that assignment, or both and is designed to give you hands-on practice with using R. Assignments typically begin in class and may be completed after class (each one is highlighted in <span style="color:orange">orange</span>) on a pass/fail basis. Students must push their completed assignment to the appropriate GitHub repository, tagging Dr. Casillas with the assignment number so that she receives a notification.

_When are the assignments due?_
Assignments listed as an 'in-class activity' are due before the start of the next class. Assignments listed as 'pre-class preparation' are due before that class begins.

_Need help?_ We will do much of this work in class, so ask your questions while we're together. Each student will be assigned to a support group of other students to help answer questions (in addition to access to help from Dr. Casillas during office hours). Finally, you're strongly encouraged to start developing your search skills when it comes to debugging your code (look for advice and solutions from others who have faced similar problems on sites like stackoverflow and github)!

### Participation

Students are generally expected to come to class prepared to practice using R together. That means: come with your charged laptop, prepared with any data you are using and any installed software that is required (see the 'preparation' note for each class). Be prepared to share your screen with your support group and with Dr. Casillas. That said, please stay in touch about your limitations regarding in-person participation; Please do not come to class if you are feeling at all ill. Students earn participation credit through their attendance and participation in their support group and discussion of course content in office hours.

### Scientific report

Your final assignment will be a scientific report in R Markdown that: is developed via a GitHub repository; includes data read-in, pre-processing, and analysis; includes at least one figure and one table with captions and in-text references; includes citations; and includes at least 1500 words of the manuscript in at least four subsections (Introductions, Methods, Results, Discussion; unless otherwise agreed with Dr. Casillas).  **Each student must come to office hours to negotiate their manuscript plan with Dr. Casillas by the end of Week 7. Grading will be contingent on the completion of that agreed-upon plan for each individual student.**
