# From Data to Manuscript in R

Winter 2022: CHDV 30550, MACS 30550, MAPS 30550

Tuesdays and Thursdays 9:30am-10:50am Chicago time

Office hours: TBA, or by appointment.

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

This course tackles the basic skills needed to build an integrated research report with the R programming language. We will cover every step from data to manuscript including: Using R's libraries to clean up and re-format messy datasets, preparing data sets for analysis, running statistical tools, generating clear and attractive figures and tables, and knitting those bits of code together with your manuscript writing. The result will be a reproducible, open-science friendly report that you can easily update after finishing data collection or receiving comments from readers. Never copy-paste your way through a table again! The R universe is large, so this course will focus specifically on: The core R libraries, the tidyverse library, and R Markdown. Students will also learn about the use of GitHub for version control.
 
**Course materials:**

* Most required readings will be drawn from one of the following great (and free! and online!) resources:
	* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham.
	* [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund
	* [R Markdown for Scientists](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/) by Nicholas Tierney

All other course materials will be available online on Canvas and the ChatterLab course webpage.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:


| Component | Undergraduates |
|-----------|----------------|
| Mini assignments | 60% |
| Participation | 20% |
| Scientific report | 20% |


### Mini assignments

There are short assignments related to the readings. There is a mini assignment for each lecture, with the exception of the first one. Each assignment will involve working with your own data, data provided for that assignment, or both and is designed to give you hands-on practice with using R. Each student will be assigned to a support group of other students to help answer questions (in addition to access to help from Marisa during office hours).

### Participation

Students are generally expected to come to class prepared to practice using R together. That means: come with your charged laptop, prepared with any data you are using and any installed software that is required. Be prepared to share your screen with your support group and with the instructor. That said, please stay in touch with Marisa about your limitations regarding in-person participation. Students earn participation credit through their attendance and participation in their support group and discussion of course content in office hours.

### Scientific report

Your final assignment will be a scientific report in R Markdown that: is developed via a GitHub repository; includes data read-in, pre-processing, and analysis; includes at least one figure and one table; includes references; and includes at least 1500 words of the manuscript in at least four subsections (Introductions, Methods, Results, Discussion).  **Each student must come to office hours to negotiate their manuscript plan with Marisa by the end of Week 7. Grading will be contingent on the completion of that agreed-upon plan for each individual student.**
