### About me

<img src="./images/rayski-lei.jpg" width="360" height="460">

I acquired my BA degree in International Relations and Psychology as well as a minor in Economics at the College of William \& Mary in 2020, and am currently pursuing a MA degree in Quantitative Methods and Social Analysis at the University of Chicago. During my undergraduate study, I worked with Dr. Harvey Langholtz on an independent Psychology research: Individualism as the Moderator of the Relationship between Conscientiousness and Job Satisfaction, where I examined how culture mediates the correlation between personality trait and psychological outcomes. In addition, I also completed a qualitative sociology research on How Charter Schools Help Promote Education Equality in America. For my prospective research, I wish to utilize quantitative methods to investigate how interactive experiences in early childhood may impact language development and mental cognition among children.
