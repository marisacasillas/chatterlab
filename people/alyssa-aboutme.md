### About me

I am a third year undergraduate student double majoring in psychology and linguistics at the University of Chicago. I joined the chatter lab as a research assistant in December 2020. Currently, I am assisting Natalie Dowling on interaction coding that examines the form, function, and sequence organization of gesture in speech. I am particularly interested in investigating the role gesture plays in the spontaneous speech of children with brain injuries, and examining the broader relationship between language and cognition.
