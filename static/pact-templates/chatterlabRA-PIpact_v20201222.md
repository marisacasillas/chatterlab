# Chatter lab research assistant-PI pact

The purpose of this document is to establish guidelines that will help you, a research assistant in the chatter lab, understand what to anticipate when it comes to work responsibilities and research opportunities in the lab.

## Your duties

* During the regular fall, winter, spring, and summer quarters, meet at least once weekly with your supervisor to discuss progress and issues regarding your work tasks.
    * Keep notes while you work on doubts, decisions, and progress so that you can discuss these with your supervisor at weekly meetings. 
* Meet at least once per quarter with Dr. Casillas to discuss:
    * Your broader goals and experiences in the lab, and
    * Evaluations of your (and our!) performance, including intellectual contributions you may have made to the work.
* Attend regular lab meetings, unless you've otherwise cleared your absence with Dr. Casillas.
    * You are strongly encouraged, but not required, to actively participate in these meetings by responding to and asking questions, adding your thoughts to discussion, suggesting papers to read/visitors to invite, giving presentations, and so on.
    * You are strongly encouraged, but not required, to do readings or attend extra presentations or other events outside of lab meeting.
* Concentrate your work during pre-arranged days/hours so that you and your supervisor can more easily manage your time.
    * Note this can be changed as needed, but changes should be documented properly.
* Respond helpfully and promptly (within 48 hours, ideally sooner) to all lab-related communications addressed directly to you unless you are on leave.
    * This may include, for example, emails, messages on Slack, and more.
* Strictly adhere to lab protocol for maintaining participant privacy.
    * This includes minimizing local copies of data on your personal laptop during remote work scenarios.
* Fastidiously update records of your work hours and your contributions after each work day in the relevant documents.
    * Shared records are critical to managing team projects!
* Always ask questions if something is not clear, whether it's an annotation task or something that happened during participant testing.
    * Ask your questions immediately, particularly regarding interactions with participants visiting the lab for research tasks.
    * Do not assume an answer; pause until you have received an adequate answer.
* Treat all members and visitors of the lab with respect.
    * Take opportunity of the fact that this is a lab in which many different experiences, perspectives, and ways of thinking will be brought to the table.
* If you witness inappropriate behavior, please promptly report it to Dr. Casillas.
    * Your anonymity will be preserved.
* If you are facing significant interruptions to your work for any reason, be prompt and honest in bringing these to your supervisor's attention so we can adapt accordingly.
* You understand that extension of your work contract in the lab is contingent upon mutual satisfaction with your previous work experience at the point of quarterly review with Dr. Casillas.

## Your rights

* You may request a meeting with Dr. Casillas at any point to discuss issues with your task(s), your immediate supervisor, or your goals for the RAship
* You may work out a semi-flexible version of your schedule with your supervisor when needed (e.g., during weeks when your courseload is particularly high) so long as this is properly documented and agreed to by Dr. Casillas.
* You have the opportunity to work on at least two projects during your time in the lab. We will do our best to align your work tasks with your interests.
* For any project you work on, you are allowed up to 6 paid work hours to do relevant reading; beyond that, reading is elective and you should spend your paid hours working on assigned tasks.
* You cannot be asked to work on a project that, for whatever reasons, makes you feel uncomfortable. If you realize this is the case, please raise the issue as soon as possible with your supervisor and/or Dr. Casillas.
* If it is determined that you have made intellectual contributions to a project, you have the right to request authorship on presentation and/or publication of the results. Though note that this comes with additional responsibilities as well. The particular additional responsibilities will need to be worked out with Dr. Casillas and the research leader for that project.
* You have the right to participate in all lab-wide events and to inquire about participation on new projects.
* You have the right to suggest new research projects for consideration by your supervisor and/or Dr. Casillas; any acceptance of your suggestion should be followed promptly by a meeting discussing your rights and responsibilities as a co-author.
* You may request a reference letter from Dr. Casillas after at least 2 months of working in the lab. Though before you do so you should discuss whether this is a good strategy in a one-on-one meeting with Dr. Casillas.
* Your supervisor and/or Dr. Casillas should respond to your lab-relevant communications within 48 hours unless they are on leave.
