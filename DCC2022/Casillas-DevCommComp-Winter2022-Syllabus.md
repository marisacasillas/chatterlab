# The development of communicative competence

Winter 2022: CHDV 38950, PSYC 38960, LING 38951, EDSO 38950

Tuesdays and Thursdays 14.00-15.20 Chicago time

Office hours: Tuesdays 15.30–16.30 in Rosenwald 318A or by appointment

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

This course examines the emergence of communicative skills in humans. We will discuss the proposed cognitive, developmental, and evolutionary roots of communicative behaviors, with a focus on current gaps in our knowledge and possible pathways forward. The course will consider these issues from multiple perspectives including linguistics, psychology, and linguistic anthropology, and will cover a wide range of methods used to analyze communicative cognition.It is expected that, by the end of the course, students will able to think and write critically about how human communication and human language are intertwined in both adults and children.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:


| Component | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| [Reading notes](./course_instructions/reading_notes.md) | 45% |
| [Transcription mini-project](./course_instructions/transcription_mini_project.md) | 15% |
| [Research proposal](./course_instructions/research_proposal.md) | 20% |
| [Participation](./course_instructions/participation.md) | 20% |


### Reading notes (45%)

Students are expected to submit digital notes summarizing and reacting to each assigned reading (~1/2 page+ each). Dr. Casillas will evaluate each student's notes for each reading: tips for effective note-taking will be covered in the first class. There are a total of 36 assigned readings, but notes are only required for 30 of them, and students may pick which 30 readings to submit notes for (i.e., students earn 1.5% for each reading with satisfactory notes).

* 30 x 1.5 point for every [reading with notes](./course_instructions/reading_notes.md)

### Transcription mini-project (15%)

Students will incrementally add annotations to a small collection of interaction clips over multiple weeks. Each time they submit new annotations, they are expected to submit short written reflections on their progress (200–500 words). The submission of annotations and reflections takes place four times (up to 3% for all four submissions). Students will also propose a mini research question that can be addressed by additional annotations of the data (up to 2%) and after executing these additional annotations, will present their findings to the class (up to 1%).

* 4 x 3 points for every [annotation + reflections submission](./course_instructions/transcription_mini_project.md#annotation-and-reflection-submission)
* 1 x 2 points for [proposal of mini research question](./course_instructions/transcription_mini_project.md#proposal-of-mini-research-question)
* 1 x 1 points for [flash presentation of findings](./course_instructions/transcription_mini_project.md#flash-presentation-of-findings)

### Research proposal (20%)

Students will propose a research project relevant to topics covered in class; proposals can be in the form of follow-up studies or a new line of research (10–15 single-spaced pages). Students will give a flash presentation of their proposed research in class (up to 2%). Full proposals are due the Tuesday of finals week (up to 18%).

To ensure timely completion of a high-quality proposal, please take advantage of the optional deadlines in the schedule below for initial drafts of the outline, design, and literature review). Dr. Casillas will give early feedback for initial drafts submitted at these deadlines so that students can improve the proposal before their final submission.

* 1 x 2 points for [flash presentation of the proposed research](./course_instructions/research_proposal.md#flash-presentation-of-the-proposed-research)
* 1 x 18 points for the [full proposal of research project](./course_instructions/research_proposal.md#full-proposal-of-research-project)

### Participation (20%)

This is a discussion-based class and students are generally expected to come to class and actively participate in discussion. By default, students are expected to attend class, ask at least one question, and respond to at least one question (max 1% per class). If the student cannot make it to class in person, but can join remotely, they should contact Dr. Casillas with a brief explanation and make use of the course Zoom link. If the student cannot join _either_ the in-person or remote class, they should contact Dr. Casillas with a brief explanation and submit one thoughtful question and response(s) to all activities and questions posed in the lecture materials to her within two days, unless noted otherwise. The last 2% of participation credit is earned by making contributions to each class debate (up to 1% each).

* 18 x 1 point for [active attendance at each class](./course_instructions/participation.md#active-attendance-at-class-sessions)
* 2 x 1 point for [contributions to the debate and the turn-taking "feature" presentation](./course_instructions/participation.md#contributions-to-the-debate-and-the-turn-taking-feature-presentation)
