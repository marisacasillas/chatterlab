# Grading guidelines: Active attendance

The Spring 2020 quarter gives us 16 class sessions together (Tuesdays and Thursdays for eight weeks). Students receive 1 point for each time they actively attend a class.

## What is active attendance?
I will ask myself the following questions after each class session. If the answers are 'yes' to all three, the student receives 1 point. Otherwise they receive 0 points.

1. was the student logged in and responsive to greetings at the start and end of class?
2. did the student ask one or more questions?
3. did the student give one or more answers or comments?

## What if I can't make it to class?
If you can't make it to class, please try and contact Marisa in advance to let her know, and add a brief note about why you can't be present. You can also email after the class is over if your inability to participate came at the last minute. **To still earn participation credit for a missed session, you should do the following:**

1. watch the recording of the session in full
2. send Marisa two questions and two comments that occurred to you while watching the recording

Unless otherwise noted, you must send these questions and comments to Marisa **within 2 days** of the missed session (i.e., missed a Tuesday = send by Thursday; missed a Thursday = send by Monday).

## Can I make up attendance credit?
Yes! If you get a zero for a session and you'd like to make up the missed credit, you can watch the recording of the session and send Marisa two questions and two comments within two days of the missed session, as instructed above for those who were unable to attend.
