Children show astonishing variation in the way they acquire their native language(s)—each developmental milestone in both production and comprehension is marked by meaningful individual differences. This 2-day workshop explores: (a) children’s linguistic and cultural environments, their non-linguistic skills, and the structural properties of the languages they are acquiring as possible sources of variation, alongside (b) the implications of this variation for the mechanisms that drive and support native language acquisition. The workshop will also include some small-group sessions aimed at advancing interdisciplinary discussion and overcoming methodological hurdles in documenting and interpreting variation in this context.
