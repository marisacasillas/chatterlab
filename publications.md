The chatter lab is founded on the principle that diversity in everyday language use is key to the study of human language cognition. We welcome opportunities to work with scholars from all walks of life, particularly those coming from minoritized groups.

Our lab at the University of Chicago is located on the traditional homelands of the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi nations.
