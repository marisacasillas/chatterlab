# The chatter lab

The chatter lab investigates the cognition of everyday human language. We explore how communicative needs impact the ways in which language is learned and used by both children and adults. To that end, we employ experimental and observational methods in multiple sites around the world to analyze the production and comprehension of conversational language.

Principal Investigator: [Dr. Marisa Casillas](./people/marisa-aboutme.md)

The chatter lab is part of the [Comparative Human Development department](https://humdev.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.

## News

* **4 March 2021:** The ACLEW project seeks to document children's early language environments across a range of linguistic communities while also improving the performance of open-source automated annotation tools for daylong recordings. Read the [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/bf63y/) of our newly accepted paper at Collabra which describes the project in detail.

* **20 January 2021:** [Newly accepted paper](./lab-publications/Cychosz_et_al_2021forthcoming_Vocal_development_in_a_large_scale_crosslinguistic_corpus_DevSci.pdf) forthcoming in Developmental Science! Led by [Meg Cychosz](https://megseekosh.github.io/), we use a citizen science crowdsourcing approach to show similar developmental timelines in children's spontaneous vocalizations across six linguistically and culturally diverse corpora. Well done Meg!
* **14 December 2020:** Big congratulations to chatter lab member [Erika Prado](https://marisacasillas.github.io/chatterlab/people/erika-aboutme.html), whose first paper was accepted for journal publication in the Journal of Research on Children and Social Interaction. Together with co-author [Mary Bucholtz](https://bucholtz.linguistics.ucsb.edu/), she describes the rich communicative practices employed by a non-speaking autistic bilingual Latino teenager in everyday getting-dressed routines. Read it [here](./lab-publications/PradoBucholtz-RoCSI-forthcoming.pdf)!
* **22–23 October 2020:** Together with [Drs. Rana Abu-Zhaya](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rana_Abu-Zhaya) and [Caroline Rowland](https://www.mpi.nl/people/rowland-caroline), and with the support of the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics](https://www.mpi.nl/), the chatter lab recently organized the Many Paths to Language workshop. Check out the handbook [here](./MPaL_handbook.md) until June 2021.

----
The chatter lab is founded on the principle that diversity in everyday language use is key to the study of human language cognition. We welcome opportunities to work with scholars from all walks of life, and particularly encourage those coming from marginalized groups to reach out if interested in working with the lab.

Our lab at the University of Chicago is located on the traditional homelands of the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi nations.
