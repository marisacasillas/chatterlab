# The chatter lab

The chatter lab investigates the cognition of everyday human language. We explore how communicative needs impact the ways in which language is learned and used by both children and adults. To that end, we employ experimental and observational methods in multiple sites around the world to analyze the production and comprehension of conversational language.

Principal Investigator: [Dr. Marisa Casillas](./marisa-personal-page.md)

The chatter lab is part of the [Comparative Human Development department](https://humdev.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.

## News

* **1 January 2021:** The chatter lab is coming to University of Chicago! Official start date is January 1st, but Dr. Casillas will be available to take your (remote) questions before then [here](./contact.md).
* **22–23 October 2020:** Together with [Drs. Rana Abu-Zhaya](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rana_Abu-Zhaya) and [Caroline Rowland](https://www.mpi.nl/people/rowland-caroline), and with the support of the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics](https://www.mpi.nl/), the chatter lab recently organized the Many Paths to Language workshop. Check out the handbook [here](./MPaL_handbook.md) until June 2021.
* **1 October 2020:** Three cheers for former PhD student Ingeborg Roete, whose first first-authored paper was just accepted in Cognitive Science. Learn more about about how one computational approach to early sentence production fits English longitudinal data from the first four years of life [here](./lab-publications/Roete_et_al_accepted_Modeling_input_statistics_in_child_speech_productions_CognitiveScience.pdf).
* **29 September 2020:** Check out our [recently published paper](./lab-publications/Casillas_et_al_2020_Early_language_experience_in_a_Papuan_community_JCL.pdf) on the daylong language environment characteristics of children growing up on Rossel Island, PNG. [As we found with Tseltal Mayan children]((./lab-publications/Casillas_et_al_2019_Early_language_experience_in_a_Tseltal_Mayan_village_ChiDev.pdf)), Rossel children are likely learning their language(s) with more than just child-directed speech.
* **6–9 July 2020:** Dr. Casillas presented on data from audio- and photo-based daylong recordings of Tseltal and Rossel children's language environments (abstracts [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12idVHgSDQIJcHN4HeHeWRhN-kkxHHd2mceR0P5aukyA/edit?usp=sharing) and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Acsnv-_bM9dYSb9eFGTBrAQAFk94-n5C7cbKsqTNYfg/edit?usp=sharing)), as well as on resources for accessing free repositories of daylong child language recordings online via [HomeBank](https://homebank.talkbank.org/) (slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NvpeuBTKIi4FaiXjvrnnpYbLgS3UITTLA_mxynY9w04/edit?usp=sharing)), at the recent virtual [International Congress of Infant Studies (vICIS)](https://infantstudies.org/program/).

----
The chatter lab is founded on the principle that diversity in everyday language use is key to the study of human language cognition. We welcome opportunities to work with scholars from all walks of life, and particularly encourage those coming from marginalized groups to reach out if interested in working with the lab.

Our lab at the University of Chicago is located on the traditional homelands of the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi nations.
