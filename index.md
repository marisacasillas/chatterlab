# The chattr lab

The chattr lab investigates the cognition of everyday human language. We explore how communicative needs impact the ways in which language is learned and used by both children and adults. To that end, we employ experimental and observational methods in multiple sites around the world to analyze the production and comphrehension of conversational language. (Principal Investigator: [Dr. Marisa Casillas]())

The chattr lab is part of the Comparative Human Development department at the University of Chicago.

The chattr lab is founded on the principle that diversity in everyday language use is key to the study of human language cognition. We welcome opportunities to work with scholars from all walks of life, particularly those coming from minoritized groups.

Our lab at the University of Chicago is located on the traditional homelands of the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi nations.
