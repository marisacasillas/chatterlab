# Grading guidelines: Annotations and reflections

You will have four chances to submit new annotations on your converation clips. Each time you submit annotations, they should come with a short paragraph reflecting on your additions. Each of the four submissions are worth up to three points.

Annotation files, conversation clips, and reflections will be kept on Box.

## Annotations
We will add four types of annotation to the clips, and all annotation will take place in ELAN. In each of the four submissions, annotation will make up 2.5 of the 3 possible points.

### Diarization
As will be covered in class, diarization is the process of finding stretches of speech and assigning them to different speakers.

Full points for diarization will be given when:

1. all hearable speech is demarcated and assigned to a speaker
2. utterance boundaries are placed with high precision at speech boundaries
3. utterances do not include pauses longer than 300 msec

### Transcription (first pass)
Transcription is the process of orthographically annotating what is said.

Full points for first-pass transcription will be given when:

1. all interpretable speech is transcribed orthographically.
2. all non-interpretable speech is indicated with 'xxx'.

### Transcription (second pass)
Second-pass transcription is for making corrections and additions to the original transcription, and will also involve the addition of several types of paralinguistic information.

Full points for second-pass transcription will be given when:

1. non-standard language is appropriately marked using minCHAT conventions (e.g., \<this one\> [=! whispers], \<prolly\> [: probably]).
2. non-linguistic communicative cues are diarized and annotated (e.g., &=laughs)
3. errors in spelling and transcription formatting are corrected.

### Student's choice
In the fourth annotation round, students will add information of their choice, in support of a mini research question they have.

Full points for this annotation round will be given when:

1. the new annotations are comprehensively added to the conversation clips
2. the student provides instructions for annotation that are clear enough for Marisa to replicate some annotations independently. _NOTE: she will test this by reading your instructions and doing some annotation before she looks at your annotations._

## Reflections
Each time you submit new annotations to Box, you should add your reflections. This should be ~200â€“300 words (max 500) answering the prompts below, as appropriate. In each of the four submissions, the reflection will make up 0.5 of the 3 possible points.

There are no correct answers here; the full 0.5 point will be awarded for responses to the questions that provide at least one _specific_ link between something learned in class and something they experienced during annotation.

### Diarization
In what ways did the organization of turns in your clips align with the ideas we have covered so far? In what ways did it deviate from expectations?

### Transcription (first pass)
What does transcription miss about interaction? How would you propose to maximize the benefits of transcription while minimizing missed information? (Be practical.)

### Transcription (second pass)
What did you neglect to notice when you first transcribed the clips? What do you think you would discover if you made a further correctional pass?

### Student's choice
How did your added annotations end up satisfying/not satisfying your research question? What's still missing?
