# Grading guidelines: Presentation of mini study of conversation clips

This assignment gives you the opportunity to present the findings of your additional annotation analysis to your fellow classmates. Your presentation should be a short video submitted at the start of class.

Full credit (4 points) for the presentation will be given when all of the following criteria are met:

1. the video is between 2 and 3 minutes long (maximum!)
2. the video is submitted no later than the start of class on the day it's due
3. why and how the annotations were added is clearly explained, with reference to class material as appropriate
4. the findings are clearly presented, with reference to class material as appropriate
5. at least one weakness and one strength or one follow-up of the mini study are pointed out

Presenting all this information in three minutes or less will be challenging; procrastination is not advised! ;)

## Late presentation?
Late presentations can be submitted within one week of the original due date with a 1 point penalty.
