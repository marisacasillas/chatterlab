## Why?
Don't notes seem a little... basic? Note taking is a fundamental  scholarly skill—one that I'm sure many of you have already practiced for years. Here are some reasons why we focus on note-taking as part of this course:

* Research on note-taking strongly suggests that it supports deep (and efficient!) learning.
* Good note-taking skills are essential for many careers, not just academic ones.
* As with most things, your ability to efficiently take high quality notes in a style that works for you can only be acquired through lots of practice.
* For remote classrooms, note-taking assignments are also a useful tool for supporting self-directed teaching and review.
* Your notes give me an opportunity to assess how well you're digesting the readings and other course content.

## How will notes be evaluated?
For full credit the notes for each reading must:

1. Have a clear title with bibliographic information and date
2. Fill at least one half page
3. Contain sketches/simplified re-drawings of at least one key figure/finding/idea
4. Be spatially separated into at least three sections: e.g., detailed notes, overall summary, comments/questions
5. Have few direct quotes or close paraphrasings; **you should reformulate thoughts in your own words**
6. Mention at least one link to another paper covered in class or your own research interests

- Notes can be made in the language of your choice, but please make sure I can use Google Translate or similar to assess points 4–6 above
- Notes can be written in a text editor, by hand (submitted as a high-resolution image), or a blend of the two.
- If you already have a technique for making notes, please contact me to discuss!

## Late reading notes?
Late notes can be submitted within one week of the original due date with a 0.5 point penalty.
