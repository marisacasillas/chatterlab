&lt;p>This course examines the emergence of communicative skills in humans. We will discuss the proposed cognitive, developmental, and evolutionary roots of communicative behaviors, with a focus on current gaps in our knowledge and possible pathways forward. The course will consider these issues from multiple perspectives including linguistics, psychology, and linguistic anthropology, and will cover a wide range of methods used to analyze communicative cognition.It is expected that, by the end of the course, students will able to think and write critically about how human communication and human language are intertwined in both adults and children.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/instructions-debate_participation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/instructions-debate_participation/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="grading-guidelines-debatefeature-presentation-participation">Grading guidelines: Debate/&amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; presentation participation&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>There is one in-class debate planned in this course, and you will receive up to 1 point for your contribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this debate, we will split up into groups and have a debate with one group arguing &lt;em>for&lt;/em> the prompt and one group arguing &lt;em>against&lt;/em> it. Groups will have a chance to work together to build their arguments and their response to the other group&amp;rsquo;s arguments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/participation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/participation/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="grading-guidelines-active-attendance">Grading guidelines: Active attendance&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Winter 2022 quarter gives us 18 class sessions together (Tuesdays and Thursdays for nine weeks). Students receive 1 point for each time they actively attend a class. The last 2 points for participation come from contributions to the two class debate and turn-taking feature presentations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="active-attendance-at-class-sessions">Active attendance at class sessions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I will ask myself the following questions after each class session. If the answers are &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; to both, the student receives 1 point.

&lt;p>This course has a total of 36 assigned readings, but notes are only required for 30 of them. Students are allowed to pick which 30 readings to submit notes for. Each reading notes submission is worth 1.5 points (max 45 points). Of course students are welcome to take notes on all 36 readings, if desired ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just in case you missed it, reading notes are 45% of your grade in this course!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/research_proposal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/research_proposal/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="grading-guidelines-research-proposal">Grading guidelines: Research proposal&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The research proposal makes up 20% of your overall grade, including up to 2% for your class presentation of the proposal and up to 18% for your full written proposal that is due during finals week. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that either link to their other areas of expertise or their favorite topics introduced during the course.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="flash-presentation-of-the-proposed-research">Flash presentation of the proposed research&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Students will present the basic idea of their research proposal to their fellow classmates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/transcription_mini_project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/transcription_mini_project/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="grading-guidelines-transcription-mini-project">Grading guidelines: Transcription mini project&lt;/h1>

&lt;h2 id="annotation-and-reflection-submission">Annotation and reflection submission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will be asked to submit new annotations on your converation clips four times during this course. Each time you submit annotations, you should &lt;em>also&lt;/em> submit a short paragraph reflecting on your experience. Each of the four submissions are worth up to three points.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/casillas-hli-spring2022-syllabus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/casillas-hli-spring2022-syllabus/</guid><description>&lt;!--
NOTES FOR NEXT TIME:

# issues w/ DM portion of experiment
- needed app to record (i.e., not on phone)
- had another thing too soon after -- can't minimize screen
- one participant needed to use phone
- rescheduling link changed the link and that meant re-sending so caused a time panic
- laptop dying/zoom crashing
- can't see participants in recording
- someone lost wifi for 20 sec
- use official uchicago Zoom account; some didn't infer this
- ... and from myself; i'm still worried somehow they are sharing videos
- ... and from myself; take two full lectures to go through instructions


MA3: Go over producer vs. signal meaning in more depth



# more on what made annotation difficult after MD
what isn't obvious in annotation?
talk that is not on task
interleaving of talk about cards
multiple card references in one utterance
simultaneous completion points
version control in submitted versions
access to lab computers
... also weird DM recordings e.g., cut-outs and re-starts making need for media re-cutting/special re-alignment of annotations for OH


Info to add to the results that were presented in class
- remainder of student data
- common names for different images
- how often people change their placements
- how often the overhearers are leaving things blank
- if people are related vs. not affect accuracy (not this year)

&lt;p>In assessing submissions for mini assignment 1, the grader will ask themselves the following questions, answering each on the scale of:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>0 = grossly incomplete/not addressed&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1 = needs significant work&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2 = minimally fulfills requirements&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3 = good effort, but with room for improvement&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4 = excellent and above expectations&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A. &lt;em>&lt;strong>Is the example thoughtfully selected?:&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> The joint activity selected by the student should be a clear case of a joint activity that is highly distinct from the (many) examples presented in the readings, lectures, and questions that came up during lecture. The activity should be specific enough and described well enough for the grader to anticipate what features of the activity will be mentioned to qualify it as “joint activity” in Clark’s scheme. The activity should be specific enough that it merits at least a few sentences of description. If your chosen activity can be construed as general (e.g., “cooking a meal”), consider instead a specific instance of that activity (e.g., “an experienced cook and a novice cook making sushi together”) so that you can dig into your explanation with a rich imagined scenario and detailed examples of how the interaction qualifies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/miniassignment2-rubric/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/miniassignment2-rubric/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="mini-assignment-2-rubric">Mini assignment 2 rubric&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>A. &lt;em>&lt;strong>Is the game thoughtfully designed?:&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> The schelling game should be clearly distinct from any of the examples in class. The game should be designed with a particular group of participants in mind, such that those specific group/community members tested can identify an effective coordination key to solve the problem successfully. Similarly, your game should be designed such that those &lt;em>outside&lt;/em> the target group/community cannot necessarily identify that same key, or may perhaps be drawn instead to another key. Your schelling game session should end with you briefly asking your participants to describe how they each made their decision. You are expected to report on how you identified and recruited participants, the exact wording you use to set up the game, any stimuli that you provide the participants, and how you record and assess the results. Your report should also mention what you &lt;em>predicted&lt;/em> you would find based on how you designed your game. Please be detailed in describing and justifying your choices in your game design.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/miniassignment3-rubric/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/miniassignment3-rubric/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="mini-assignment-3-rubric">Mini assignment 3 rubric&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>In assessing submissions for mini assignment 3, the grader will ask themselves the following questions, answering each on the scale of:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>1 = needs significant work&lt;/p>

&lt;p>4 = excellent and above expectations&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A. &lt;em>&lt;strong>Are the examples clear and creatively varied?:&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> You should choose your examples from sources that we (the graders) have access to. That likely means giving us links to videos, audio recordings, or social media posts, but could also include things like attaching images of visual or textual signals if that is what you have decided to discuss. So, for each example, make sure to &lt;em>give us access to the original source&lt;/em> you got it from. All examples should clearly illustrate the difference between signal meaning and speaker meaning; it&amp;rsquo;s alright (even encouraged) if there is some &amp;rsquo;twist&amp;rsquo; or complication in the relationship between these types of meaning. The three examples should be chosen to illustrate the wide variety of ways in which these two meaning types can diverge. Ideally, your examples should be chosen to explore a &lt;em>clear theme&lt;/em> in signal-based communication of your choosing (e.g., exploring parallel differences in meaning types across multiple communicative modalities). Be creative in choosing these examples (and have some fun searching for them)!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/miniassignment4-rubric/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/miniassignment4-rubric/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="mini-assignment-4-rubric">Mini assignment 4 rubric&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>4 = excellent and above expectations&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A. &lt;em>&lt;strong>Do the selected gestures illustrate course concepts in a thoughtful or innovative way?:&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> It will be fairly easy to find examples of conversation with depictive gestures. A paper that goes &amp;ldquo;above expectations&amp;rdquo; will have examples that are not just &lt;em>clear&lt;/em> but illustrate a non-typical or unexpected case that put course concepts to the test in some way. For example, Holler &amp;amp; Wilkin&amp;rsquo;s (2011) study made the observation that depictive mimicry was a critical mechanism for grounding in the tangram task, thereby illustrating the special role that gesture can above and beyond linguistic signals in conversation. That is a high bar of an example—we don&amp;rsquo;t expect anyone to make a groundbreaking discovery in their mini assignment. Rather we encourage you to keep an eye out for examples that strike you as complicated, interesting, or unexpected in some way and then to examine what it is about those depictive gestures that caught your eye, using course concepts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/scientificreport-rubric/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/scientificreport-rubric/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="scientific-report-rubric">Scientific report rubric&lt;/h1>

&lt;li>Is the research question clear, specific, and answerable?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is the research question novel and/or creative in some way?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does the proposed method of study and the proposed analysis give a targeted answer to the research question?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does the literature review support the relevance of the research question and the methods and analysis proposed?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consider how specific the results would be to a single context/population: Is that specificity appropriate to the scope of the research question?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is the discussion of the &amp;ldquo;if so&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; scenario thorough and made to match the scope of the literature review and research question?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is the discussion of the &amp;ldquo;if not&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; scenario thorough and made to match the scope of the literature review and research question?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does the proposal demonstrate thoughtful integration of course concepts together with the student&amp;rsquo;s own ideas?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is the proposal well written, typo-free, and easy to understand?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are there at least 5 research papers cited?&lt;/li>

&lt;h3 id="the-thesis">The thesis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As nicely laid out up front:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Communication is impossible in the sense of logical signal encoding/decoding&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Despite this, humans communicate effectively all the time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To do so they must use non-logical heuristics and some kinds of special reasoning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For communication to work so well so often humans also need to keep these heuristics and modes of reasoning at the front of their minds at all times&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The consequence of which is that the same heuristics/reasoning affect cognition in non-communicative contexts (think, e.g., Tversky &amp;amp; Kahneman)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="part-1-interactional-intelligence-coordination-and-communication">Part 1. Interactional intelligence, coordination, and communication&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There is a sort of &lt;strong>intellect for interaction&lt;/strong>: Human interactional abilities are robust to wide variation in sociocultural and neurophysiological states, and while there is some evidence for specialization as a socialized species (e.g., face recognition, very early incipient interactional skills) as well as some sub-populations for whom (neurotypical) interactional behaviors are not as readily implemented (e.g., those on the autism spectrum), interaction requires cognitive means that cross-cut any modularizable set of skills or experiences.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Relevant question becomes &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;what are the underlying conceptual abilities that make social interaction possible&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> (p. 225)?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Computationally, interaction feels impossible
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Adults can fairly easily coordinate with extremely little information shared between them (e.g., where to meet when, given no other prompt in Schelling-type experiments); their ability to do so relies on the salience of certain shared information and their ability to recognize and act on mutually salient information. In this sense, conceiving of interaction as a game of payoffs, in the sense of game theory, is (depending on your view) either intractable or trivial; cooperation and coordination are at the forefront of success rather than some pre-formulated benefit to the signal producer (in other words, the preferences of the participants are not independent).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another way to think about this is that, because cooperation implicitly and at all times requires mutual consideration, and because communication is never guaranteed, it is computationally more complex to engage in effectively.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The work around this, at least from the addressee&amp;rsquo;s perspective has focused on the &amp;ldquo;mind reading&amp;rdquo; part of the problem, often referred to as &lt;strong>intention attribution&lt;/strong>. We can go down many philosophical rabbit holes here, but the key problem involves at least (1) recognizing that a signal was produced with communicative intent and (2) using the first piece of information to infer what the communicative intent was. More or less, this is just &lt;strong>Gricean&lt;/strong> inference, to which can be added other information and heuristics. Levinson focuses on two types for the rest of section 1.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>stereotyped thinking&lt;/strong> (e.g., Goody, 1978): in the broadest sense this is a reflection of what is likely given past experience with people, objects, and actions in the world (e.g., the later example of what can be expected at the service counter in the train station)&lt;img src="figures/GoodyStereotypes.jpg" alt="GoodyStereotypes">&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>sequence organization&lt;/strong> (e.g., Schegloff, 2007): the use of interactional contingency to restrict the relevance of possible prompts and answers at any given point in interaction&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tricky computational issues that arise when we take interaction seriously include:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Computations aren&amp;rsquo;t done over propositions per-se but states of propositional belief in the addressee and as shared between interactants, which may themselves be &amp;lsquo;as-if&amp;rsquo; or may not have internatl consistency&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establishing mutual belief is infinitely regressive without some intervention/heuristic (e.g., &amp;hellip; A believes that B believes that A believes that B believes that A believes that B believes that A intended p by saying u)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A parallel problem arises with the Gricean framework with respect to A intends that B recognize that A intends that B recognize that A &amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whereas mutually salient concepts are critical for interactional success, defining how it arises and how concepts are differentially relevantly activated is a big puzzle&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human logic isn&amp;rsquo;t rational in any obvious sense: it can be overly specific, display one-to-many input/output relations, is computed with respect to context, and can&amp;rsquo;t be reverse computed (see p. 230&amp;ndash;232 for examples), which makes it feel impossible to descriptively encapsulate in a framework of rational communication&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BUT WAIT, ISN&amp;rsquo;T INTENTION JUST EXPRESSED VIA LINGUSTIC CODES? THAT&amp;rsquo;S WHAT LANGUAGE IS FOR!(?) Not precisely. Three things to consider:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Linguistic codes (i.e., lexical semantics + morphosyntax) certainly have an important role to play, but are far too ambiguous to, on their own, live up to the specificity of conveyed information. The example here is with, e.g., &amp;ldquo;at&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;the man is at the door&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the car is at the door&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the man is at work&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;consider the differing spatial imagery and scenario-specific relevant information pulled up by those different examples.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In natural conversation, much of the language use is neither direct nor literal (see examples from 235&amp;ndash;237), but interlocutors still manage to coordinate quickly (the balance of giving relatively little information seems sufficient most of the time, i.e., when coordination is already well underway). Consider, e.g., &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rsquo;d you put the thingamajig?&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;over there.&amp;rdquo; Remember, this kind of language use is arguably our normal way of doing things, particularly across human society and deep into human history. A really important part of this point is that interaction is live! So the ability to get feedback in real-time may be critical to the design of this system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Communication is not just possible but often equally fluent with non-conventional and non-linguistic signaling (see more work from Herb Clark on this point)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>So while linguistic codes can and do hugely help this process along (e.g., by pointing to intended referents, by conventional marking certain sequence initiators like wh-questions), they are not strictly necessary for successful communication and are too flexible to be depended on as a primary source of intentional meaning in many ordinary circumstances. Or as Levinson says, &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;we think specifically, we talk generally. I can&amp;rsquo;t say what I mean in some absolute sense: I have to take into account what you think I will mean by it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> (p. 232).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Big picture claim: this is really where enculturation and language meet. In other words, his hypothesis is that &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo; as a body of concepts largely overlaps with the set of heuristics for intention attribution&amp;mdash;the very same ones we used to relate speaker action with speaker intent during language use. in other words the &amp;ldquo;computational miracle&amp;rdquo; of communication breaks down to our mutual access to what is normal on average, what is likely in the current circumstances, and how one can use those sources of information to design communicative acts.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This course examines the social and cognitive mechanisms that drive language learning in the first few years of life. Nearly all children learn the language(s) of their community, despite the fact that human languages and caregiving practices offer immense diversity around the globe. What enables the learning system to adapt so robustly to the environment it finds itself in? We discuss the evidence for and against multiple factors that have been proposed to support language development across the world’s communities. We also critically examine how these ideas intersect with current deficit models of language learning.
It is expected that, by the end of the course, students will grasp the basic mechanisms proposed to underlie early language learning and will design a novel research project to test one of these mechanisms in infants or young children.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/methods_presentations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/methods_presentations/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="grading-guidelines-methods-presentations">Grading guidelines: Methods presentations&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>This is a groupwork project, but group members will have an opportunity to report on individual contributions. There are three primary components to each presentation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Give a 20-minute &lt;strong>pre-recorded&lt;/strong> mini lecture that introduces a method and gives some sort of demonstration of how the method is implemented and how it appears to participants.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Elicit and answer questions from the class about the method (~10-15 minutes). You are encouraged to use creative techniques to stimulate discussion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fill out a peer evaluation form for yourself and your group members.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In preparing the presentation, each group will be asked to inteview at least one researcher who has expertise in that method. Each group must provide some media files (photo, video, audio) to support their demonstration, and should additionally provide some kind of explanation of how the analysis is done following data collection. Check out the FAQs below for more info!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/mini-essay-exam-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/mini-essay-exam-1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="mini-essay-exam-1">Mini essay exam 1&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Three times throughout the quarter, undergraduate students will be expected to complete a mini essay exam. Each mini essay exam requires students to give ~500 word responses to two prompts. The exams are take-home and open-book; students have one week to complete each exam. Each exam is worth a total of 10 points (10% of the total grade) as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mini essay exam 1:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Response 1 (5 points max)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/participation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/participation/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="grading-guidelines-participation">Grading guidelines: Participation&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Participation points (up to 20 points/20% of the final grade) can be earned in two ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Active attendance during class sessions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visits to office hours&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The Winter 2021 quarter gives us 18 class sessions together (Tuesdays and Thursdays for nine weeks). Students receive 1 point for each time they &lt;strong>actively&lt;/strong> attend a class (see below).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Students will receive 2 points for an office hours discussion with Marisa.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/reading_notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/reading_notes/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="grading-guidelines-reading-notes">Grading guidelines: Reading notes&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This course includes up to 39 readings. Notes for required readings are due by the start of class. &lt;strong>Please have your notes accessible during class.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Undergraduates&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Undergraduate students will be assigned a total of 26 readings, but notes are only required for 24 of them. Each reading notes submission is worth 1.25 points each (maximum 30 points; 30% of the final grade). Students can choose for themselves which of the readings they would like to submit notes for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/squibs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/squibs/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="grading-guidelines-squibs">Grading guidelines: Squibs&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Over the quarter, graduate students are expected to produce six very brief (~1500–2500 word) papers on the topic of their choice related to course content. These &amp;ldquo;squibs&amp;rdquo; are used to engage further with ideas from the readings and, hopefully, to develop new ideas that can feed into the graduate student&amp;rsquo;s core work.**&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-squib">What is a squib?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Squibs are personal to your research interests—they are here for you to make concrete connections with what we are discussing in class and what you are thinking about in your Masters/PhD work. There is no right answer and Marisa will mostly just be checking to see whether you are thoughtfully engaging with course content.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
