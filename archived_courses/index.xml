This course examines the emergence of communicative skills in humans. We will discuss the proposed cognitive, developmental, and evolutionary roots of communicative behaviors, with a focus on current gaps in our knowledge and possible pathways forward.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/instructions-debate_participation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/instructions-debate_participation/</guid><description>Grading guidelines: Debate/&amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; presentation participation Group debate: Turn-taking behaviors are universal to communicative systems There is one in-class debate planned in this course, and you will receive up to 1 point for your contribution.
In this debate, we will split up into groups and have a debate with one group arguing for the prompt and one group arguing against it.

Students receive 1 point for each time they actively attend a class. The last 2 points for participation come from contributions to the two class debate and turn-taking feature presentations.
Active attendance at class sessions I will ask myself the following questions after each class session. If the answers are &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; to both, the student receives 1 point.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/reading_notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/dcc2022/course_instructions/reading_notes/</guid><description>Grading guidelines: Reading notes This course has a total of 36 assigned readings, but notes are only required for 30 of them.

Tuesdays and Thursdays 9:30am-10:50am Chicago time
Language may be learned by individuals, but we most often use it for communication between groups. How is it that we manage to transmit our internal thoughts to others&amp;rsquo; minds? How is it that we can understand what others mean to express to us? Whether we are greeting a passerby, ordering a meal, or debating politics, there are a number of invisible processes that bring language to life in the space between individuals.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/miniassignment1-rubric/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/hli2022/miniassignment1-rubric/</guid><description>Mini assignment 1 rubric [main page]

A succinctly stated question directly derived from the week’s readings and lecture (two-three sentences at most).

Students earn up to 10 points (10% of the total grade) for each one.
This is a groupwork project, but group members will have an opportunity to report on individual contributions. There are three primary components to each presentation:
Give a 20-minute pre-recorded mini lecture that introduces a method and gives some sort of demonstration of how the method is implemented and how it appears to participants.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/mini-essay-exam-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/mini-essay-exam-1/</guid><description>Mini essay exam 1 Please use information from the readings, lectures, and in-class sessions to inform your answers.

Each mini essay exam requires students to give ~500 word responses to two prompts. The exams are take-home and open-book; students have one week to complete each exam. Each exam is worth a total of 10 points (10% of the total grade) as follows:
Mini essay exam 1:
Response 1 (5 points max)</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/participation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/participation/</guid><description>Grading guidelines: Participation Participation points (up to 20 points/20% of the final grade) can be earned in two ways:
Active attendance during class sessions Visits to office hours The Winter 2021 quarter gives us 18 class sessions together (Tuesdays and Thursdays for nine weeks). Students receive 1 point for each time they actively attend a class (see below).
Students will receive 2 points for an office hours discussion with Marisa.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/reading_notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/reading_notes/</guid><description>Grading guidelines: Reading notes This course includes up to 39 readings. Notes for required readings are due by the start of class. Please have your notes accessible during class.
Undergraduates
Undergraduate students will be assigned a total of 26 readings, but notes are only required for 24 of them. Each reading notes submission is worth 1.25 points each (maximum 30 points; 30% of the final grade). Students can choose for themselves which of the readings they would like to submit notes for.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/squibs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/archived_courses/winter2021/course-instructions/squibs/</guid><description>Grading guidelines: Squibs Over the quarter, graduate students are expected to produce six very brief (~1500–2500 word) papers on the topic of their choice related to course content. These &amp;ldquo;squibs&amp;rdquo; are used to engage further with ideas from the readings and, hopefully, to develop new ideas that can feed into the graduate student&amp;rsquo;s core work.**
What is a squib? Squibs are personal to your research interests—they are here for you to make concrete connections with what we are discussing in class and what you are thinking about in your Masters/PhD work.</description></item></channel></rss>
