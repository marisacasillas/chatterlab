# Grading guidelines: Annotations and reflections

You will be asked to submit new annotations on your converation clips four times during this course. Each time you submit annotations, you should _also_ submit a short paragraph reflecting on your experience. Each of the four submissions are worth up to three points.

## Annotations
All annotation will take place in ELAN. For each of the four submissions, the actual annotations you create will make up 2.5 of the 3 possible points for the assignment. Points will be assigned as follows:

### Assignment 1: Diarization
As we will cover in class, diarization is the process of finding stretches of speech and assigning them to different speakers.

Full points for diarization will be given when:

1. all hearable speech is demarcated and assigned to a speaker
2. utterance boundaries are placed with high precision at speech boundaries
3. utterances do not include pauses longer than 300 msec

### Assignment 2: Transcription (first pass)
Transcription is the process of orthographically annotating what is said.

Full points for first-pass transcription will be given when:

1. all interpretable speech is transcribed orthographically
2. all non-interpretable speech is indicated with 'xxx'

### Assignment 3: Transcription (second pass)
Second-pass transcription is meant for making corrections and additions to the original transcription, and will also involve the addition of several types of paralinguistic information.

Full points for second-pass transcription will be given when:

1. non-standard language is appropriately marked using minCHAT conventions (e.g., \<this one\> [=! whispers], \<prolly\> [: probably])
2. non-linguistic communicative cues are diarized and annotated (e.g., &=laughs)
3. errors in spelling and transcription formatting are corrected

### Assignment 4: Student's choice
In the fourth annotation round, students will add information of their choice, in support of a mini research question they have proposed.

Full points for this annotation round will be given when:

1. the new annotations are comprehensively added to the conversation clips
2. the student provides instructions for annotation that are clear enough for Marisa to replicate some of the annotations independently.

_NOTE: she will test this second criterion by reading your instructions and doing some annotation before she looks at your annotations._

## Reflections
Each time you submit new annotations, you should add a paragraph with your reflections about the annotation process. This should be very short, ~200â€“300 words (max 500), answering the prompts below, as appropriate. In each of the four submissions, the reflection will make up 0.5 of the 3 possible points.

There are no correct answers here; the full 0.5 point will be awarded for responses to the questions that provide at least one _specific_ link between something learned in class and something the student experienced during annotation.

### Assignment 1: Diarization
In what ways did the organization of turns in your clips align with the ideas we have covered so far? In what ways did it deviate from expectations?

### Assignment 2: Transcription (first pass)
What does transcription miss about interaction? What would you add to basic orthographic transcription to enrich your data? (Be practical.)

### Assignment 3: Transcription (second pass)
What did you neglect to notice when you first transcribed the clips? What do you think you would discover if you made a further correctional pass?

### Assignment 4: Student's choice
How did your added annotations end up satisfying/not satisfying your research question? What's still missing?


## Late annotation assignments?
Late annotations and reflections can be submitted within a week of the original due date with a 0.5 point penalty.
