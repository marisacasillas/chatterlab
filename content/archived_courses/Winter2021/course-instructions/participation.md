# Grading guidelines: Participation

Participation points (up to 20 points/20% of the final grade) can be earned in two ways:

1. Active attendance during class sessions
2. Visits to office hours

The Winter 2021 quarter gives us 18 class sessions together (Tuesdays and Thursdays for nine weeks). Students receive 1 point for each time they **actively** attend a class (see below).

Students will receive 2 points for an office hours discussion with Marisa.

The total maximum amount of participation points is 20. A total of 4 points can be earned in office hours visits. Additional visits to office hours are always welcome, but won't count toward the student's grade.

## What is active attendance?

I will ask myself the following questions after each class session. If the answers are 'yes' to at least two of the three, the student receives 1 point. Otherwise the student receives receive 0 points for the session.

1. Was the student logged in and responsive to greetings at the start and end of class?
2. Did the student ask one or more questions?
3. Did the student give one or more answers or comments?

## How should I prepare for office hours participation?

To gain full participation points for each office hours visit, the student must come prepared with 2+ substantive questions or comments from a reading or lecture. Questions relating to assignments or minor clarifications are also welcome, but will not contribute toward participation points.

## What if I can't make it to class?

If you can't make it to class, please try and contact Marisa in advance to let her know, and add a brief note about why you can't be present. You can also email after the class is over if your inability to participate came at the last minute.

To still earn participation credit for a missed session, you can do the following:

1. Watch the recording of the session in full
2. Send Marisa two questions and two comments that occurred to you while watching the recording

Unless otherwise noted, you must send these questions and comments to Marisa **within 2 days** of the missed session (i.e., missed a Tuesday = send by midnight on Thursday; missed a Thursday = send by midnight on Monday).

## Can I make up attendance credit?
Yes! If you get a zero for a class session and you'd like to make up the missed credit, you can watch the recording of the session and send Marisa two questions and two comments within two days of the missed session, as described above for those who were unable to attend.
