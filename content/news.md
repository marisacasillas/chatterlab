* **4 October 2021:** We officially kicked off a new project "Object handling and early word learning environments in three cultural contexts".

We will annotate many thousands of images taken from children's perspective during their days at home in three cultural contexts: Papuan, Mayan, and US. This project is made possible by generous funding from the Gianinno family.
