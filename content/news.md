### October 2021
* We officially kicked off a new project "Object handling and early word learning environments in three cultural contexts". Our new team of 5 undergraduates includes Anapaula Silva, Mara Duquette, Will Fisher, [Lizzie Mickiewicz](../bios/lizzie-aboutme/), and Kimberly Shorter, as well as Mary Elliott and [Kennedy Casey](https://kennedycasey.github.io/). We will annotate many thousands of images taken from children's perspective during their days at home in three cultural contexts: Papuan, Mayan, and US. This project is made possible by generous funding from the Gianinno family.
