### June 2022
* [Natalie Dowling](https://www.nrdowling.com/) successfully defended her dissertation: _Obviously I Don't Know but Whatever: Emblematic and Pragmatic Uses of Shrug Gestures in Early Childhood and Adolescence_. Congratulations, Dr. Dowling! She will return to the lab as a postdoctoral fellow in the fall.
* Three new research assistants joined our team for the summer, including [Alexander Stern](../bios/alexander-aboutme/), [Sarah Sommer](../bios/sarah-aboutme/), and Carla Suarez Soto.

    * [Kennedy Casey](../bios/kennedy-aboutme/) is giving a talk entitled "Children's shift from CDS to ADS vocabulary across early childhood" which is in the symposium _Children's exposure to and use of socially meaningful variation in language_ (led by [Marisa Casillas](../bios/marisa-aboutme/))

* The stellar [Kennedy Casey](../bios/kennedy-aboutme/)'s first journal publication is now online at _PLOS ONE_, charting the representation of female vs. male protagonists in 60 years of children's books. Double congratulations to Kennedy! Read it [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0260566).

* [Marisa Casillas](../bios/marisa-aboutme/) (project lead), together with colleagues [Sharese King](https://www.drshareseking.com/), [Ruthe Foushee](https://ruthefoushee.com/), [Adriana Weisleder](https://childlanguagelab.northwestern.edu/people/), and [Annette D'Onofrio](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~akd2621/), was awarded a Neubauer Collegium Faculty Research Fund for their project "Roots of Linguistic Identity". The project, which will begin in June 2022, will investigate how children from different dialect backgrounds across Chicago learn to recognize variability in the sounds and words of other dialects.

### November 2021
* [Alex Cristia](https://sites.google.com/site/acrsta/) and [Marisa Casillas](../bios/marisa-aboutme/) submitted a revision to their paper on non-word repetition in Yélî Dnye. Fingers crossed! Read the preprint [here](../lab-publications/Cristia_Casillas_underreview2_Nonword_repetition_in_children_learning_Yeli_Dnye_v20211125.pdf).

### October 2021
* We officially kicked off a new project "Object handling and early word learning environments in three cultural contexts". Our new team of 5 undergraduates includes Anapaula Silva, Mara Duquette, Will Fisher, [Lizzie Mickiewicz](../bios/lizzie-aboutme/), and [Kimberly Shorter](../bios/kimberly-aboutme/), as well as Mary Elliott and [Kennedy Casey](../bios/kennedy-aboutme/). We will annotate many thousands of images taken from children's perspective during their days at home in three cultural contexts: Papuan, Mayan, and US. This project is made possible by generous funding from the Gianinno family.
