### About me 

{{< figure src="/img/people/sarah-kelso.jpg" width=330 height=400 >}}

I am a third year studying Psychology and Comparative Human Development. I joined the Chatter Lab in April 2023. I am especially interested in childhood development and often find myself drawn to topics involving language acquisition, but I am also interested in mental health and psychiatric disorders.
