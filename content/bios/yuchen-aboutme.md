{{< figure src="/img/people/yuchen-jin.jpg" width=430 height=400 >}}

I am a doctoral student in the Department of Comparative Human Development. Before coming to Chicago, I completed my BA in Education at Zhejiang University and Ed.M. in Human Development and Psychology at Harvard University. Broadly, my research interests include 
child lingusitic and communicative development, parent-child interaction, and in particular, how children become adapted to conversational turn-taking.
