### About me
{{< figure src="/img/people/yuchen-jin.jpg" width=430 height=400 >}}

I am a joint PhD student in Comparative Human Development and Psychology. Before coming to Chicago, I completed my BA in Education at Zhejiang University and Ed.M. in Human Development and Psychology at Harvard University. I am broadly interested in early linguistic and communication development. Currently, I am focusing on how varying participatory roles within interactions—such as those of direct addressees and overhearers—contribute to the acquisition of linguistic knowledge and communicative acts.
