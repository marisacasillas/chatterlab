### About me

{{< figure src="/img/people/kennedy-casey.jpg" width=430 height=400 >}}

I am the current lab manager. I joined the chatter lab in summer 2021 after completing my BA degree at Princeton University, where I concentrated in Psychology and also studied Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Neuroscience. During undergrad, I worked primarily with Dr. Casey Lew-Williams, and my thesis research combined eye-tracking and corpus-based observational methods to investigate how infants learn and represent some of their earliest words. I am excited to continue using multi-method—and particularly naturalistic—approaches to better understand the richness and diversity of children's early language environments. Broadly, my ongoing research focuses on how young learners extract meaningful information from complex, everyday communicative contexts and explores which cues (linguistic, environmental, social, etc.) may support them most in doing so.
