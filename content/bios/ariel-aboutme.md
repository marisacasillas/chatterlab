### About me

{{< figure src="/img/people/ariel-wang.jpg" height=400 >}}
<br>
I am a first year undergraduate student intending to major in Public Policy and Economics at the University of Chicago. I am interested in exploring the intersection between behavioral science and law in the realm of policy, economics and beyond, with a focus on the criminal justice system. I joined the Chatter Lab in February 2024, hoping to learn more about how language and dialect influence the developmental pathways of people from different backgrounds.
