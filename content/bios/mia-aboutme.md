<br>
I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago where I major in Anthropology with a focus in Archaeology and minor in Classical Studies. I joined the chatter lab as a research assistant this January. My research focuses on diasporic identity formation processes, particularly on how embodied practices affect perceptions of selfhood and collective belonging.
