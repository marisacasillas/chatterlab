### About me

{{< figure src="/img/people/mary-norgan.jpg" width=600 height=300 >}}

I am a fourth year undergraduate student studying neuroscience and psychology at the University of Chicago. I joined the chatter lab as an undergraduate research assisant in January of 2021 and I am excited for the projects I am getting to work on! I am interested in the neurological basis of human development and behavior.
