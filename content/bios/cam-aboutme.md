{{< figure src="/img/people/cam-friedman.jpg" width=360 height=460 >}}


I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago majoring in psychology. I joined the chatter lab in June of 2022, and I'm very interested in industrial/organizational psychology and how it can be influenced by various forms of communication.
