### About me

{{< figure src="/img/people/jenny-bo.jpg" height=400 >}}

I am currently a master student in the MAPSS - Psychology program at the University of Chicago. My undergrad was at the University of Maryland (College Park), in which I pursued a double degree in Psychology and Marketing. During my time there, I worked with PI Savreen Hundal on exploring the roles of culture in terms of emotional regulation strategies between the American and international Chinese students population. I also worked with Dr. Michele Gelfand to apply the tight and looseness cultures concept to variating scenarios such as COVID and natural disaster country responses.  

My interest lies primarily at the intersection of culture and language, especially towards how communication skills and language learning impact different populations, especially international students.
