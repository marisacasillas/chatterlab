### About me

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Psychology and Anthropology. I joined the chatter lab in June of 2022. I am interested in the development of social cognition, investigating the factors that shape the patterns and behaviors in communication, and how this understanding provides insights to enhance and bolster education.
