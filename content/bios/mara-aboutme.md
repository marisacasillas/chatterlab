### About me

{{< figure src="/img/people/mara-duquette.jpg" width=360 height=460 >}}

I am a third-year undergraduate student double majoring in Linguistics and Global Studies. I recently joined the chatter lab as a research assistant in September 2021. Currently, I am assisting with a project focused on object-centered learning in childhood language acquisition. Broadly speaking, I am interested in linguistic diversity and accessibility.
