### About me

{{< figure src="/img/people/lizzie-mickiewicz.jpg" height=400 >}}

I am a third year undergraduate student majoring in psychology and neuroscience at the University of Chicago. I am interested in exploring how cognitive processes influence language and vice versa.  Specifically, I am fascinated by the idea of music as a language and means of communication, and I would like to study music medicine in the future.
