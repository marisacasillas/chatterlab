### About me

{{< figure src="/img/people/lizzie-mickiewicz.jpg" height=400 >}}
<br>
I am a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in neuroscience and psychology at the University of Chicago. I am interested in exploring the influence of cognitive processes on language and vice versa, with a focus on incorporating both naturalistic and experimental measures in my work. 

Currently, I am working on my senior thesis project, studying whether the phenomenon of infant phoneme discrimination can accurately be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).  I am also using fNIRS to investigate how the use of gestures may influence childrenâ€™s learning of math on a project headed by Amanda Seccia, a post-doctoral student in the [Environmental Neuroscience Lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/bermanlab/) and [Goldin-Meadow Lab](https://voices.uchicago.edu/goldinmeadowlab/).  I am also helping conduct an eye-tracking study interested in what features of spoken language children use to predict turn-taking in conversations.  

In previous work, I have annotated child-centric, daylong images to investigate whether the objects children hold throughout the day influence their language acquisition patterns.  I have also coded gaze data to further explore the effects of mispronunciation in cross-cultural communities.  

Beyond my time at UChicago, I am looking to engage full-time with research in the fields of neuroscience and psychology before applying to graduate school in those areas.
