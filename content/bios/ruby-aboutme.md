Hi! My name is Ruby Swensen. I am in my second year as an undergraduate student studying linguistics with an emphasis in American Sign Language and a special interest in comparative human development. I joined the Chatter Lab in January 2023 excited to learn more about the many applications of language on human interaction and behavior. When Iâ€™m not studying or working in the lab, I love to go ice skating on the midway!
