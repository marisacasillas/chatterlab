### About me

{{< figure src="/img/people/isabella-digiovanni.jpg" width=360 height=400 >}}

I am a second year PhD student in the Department of Comparative Human Development at the University of Chicago. I received my BA from Cornell University, where I studied Linguistics and Psychology with a minor in Cognitive Science. As an undergrad I worked with Professor Michael Goldstein and was involved in multiple research projects exploring early language learning in social contexts. Broadly, I am interested in language acquisition and development in social contexts, and in cross-linguistic and cross-cultural comparison. I am particularly interested in working with understudied languages, and I also have an interest in endangered language revitalization.
