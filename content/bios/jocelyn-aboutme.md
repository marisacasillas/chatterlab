## Jocelyn Zacarias (she/her/hers)

### About me
I am a second-year undergraduate studying psychology and comparative human development at the University of Chicago. I joined the Chatter Lab in June of 2024. I am interested in the social factors that shape language mechanisms and acquisition, particularly how cultural settings and interactions within them influence this process.
