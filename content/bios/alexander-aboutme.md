### About me

{{< figure src="/img/people/alexander-stern.jpg" width=360 height=460 >}}

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago studying Linguistics and Urban Studies. I joined the chatterlab as a research assistant in June 2022. At the confluence of my academic interests, I want to investigate how language mediates an individualâ€™s interactions with their society.
