### About me

{{< figure src="/img/people/subin-kim.JPEG" height=400 >}}
<br>
I joined the Chatter Lab in summer 2023 after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania with majors in Linguistics and Computer Information Science. During undergrad, I worked primarily with Dr. Delphine Dahan to study how we interpret questions in conversation. My primary research interests are in the intersections of psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, and language acquisition, with a focus on natural conversation.
