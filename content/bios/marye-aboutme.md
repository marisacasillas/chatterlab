### About me

I am a speech language pathology masters student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I received my bachelor of science degree in linguistics and cultural anthropology from Northeastern University. I joined the chatter lab as a research assistant in February 2021.  Currently, I am helping with a project investigating the carrying practices of two Indigenous communities in Papua New Guinea and Mexico. Broadly, I am interested in the interaction between language and culture, especially in how that interaction affects language learning.
