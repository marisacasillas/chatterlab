### Principal Investigator: Dr. Marisa Casillas
Marisa (she/her) is an assistant professor in the University of Chicago's Comparative Human Development department. Before coming to Chicago, she completed her BA (UCLA) and PhD (Stanford University) in Linguistics, followed by postdoctoral work at the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics](https://www.mpi.nl/) in the Netherlands. Her research draws on linguistics, psychology, and conversation analysis to investigate the foundations of human language cognition. She conducts observational and experimental work on adult and child language behavior in American English, Dutch, Tseltal (Mayan), and Yélî Dnye (isolate; Papua New Guinea), but maintains active collaborations with researchers working on other languages, including Sign Language of the Netherlands and Tsimane'. Her work, which has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Acoustical Society of America, and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, touches on a wide range of language topics, from comparative developmental language theory to open-source speech technology.
