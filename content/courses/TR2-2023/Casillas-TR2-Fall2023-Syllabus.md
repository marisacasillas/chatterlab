**Quarter:** Fall 2023

**Class:** Thursdays 9:30am-12:20pm

**Office hours:** Book online [here](https://calendar.app.google/9DB3dUzBffuLWqHA9) in Rosenwald 318A or Zoom (please indicate in your online booking)

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

This is a workshop course to help you progress in drafting your master's thesis. We will discuss practical writing strategies, share early drafts, give feedback, and learn a bit about academic publishing. By the end of the course you should have a first full draft of your paper. Our mantra will be "writing is rewriting". Assignments are noted in <span style="color:green">green text</span>.

## Grading 

You will propose your own final grade. Your grade should reflect the progress you made on your thesis, relative to the plan you set out at the start of the quarter.

## Participation

Active participation is mandatory—any absences should be cleared by the instructor. In this course, active participation means:

* arrive on time, with your laptop/charger,
* ask questions and make comments during class,
* complete all assignments on time,
* read your peers' work carefully,
* give feedback that is _constructive_.

### Optional, but recommended at the end of the quarter
1. Run your latest draft by your advisor and initiate a meeting to figure out the following:
    - the long term goals for the paper (where can it eventually be submitted for review? Where can it be sent for feedback (e.g. conferences, workshops, etc) in the meantime?),
    - the strengths and weaknesses of the paper as it stands and a general plan of action for the next draft(s),
    - what needs to change to have a passing TR.
2. Consult the graduate manual for official deadlines for final submission and hearing.
    - Reach out to Janice or to your advisor as soon as possible if you have questions.
3. Formulate and document a plan for making regular progress going forward.
    - Try updating/adapting your strategic plan.
    - Reach out to cohort members, other friends, and/or your advisor to find accountability opportunities.
