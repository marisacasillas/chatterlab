# Reading questions

For each reading you are expected to demonstrate your understanding by responding to a handful of questions.

There are no right answers, but there are thoughtful answers. If you did not understand something, it is encouraged to be honest as long as you _also_ outline what you did understand and what the primary barriers were for you to understanding more.

Reading questions are an essential component of each student's participation grade.

**Reading questions for the readings assigned on each class session are due (on Canvas) by the START of THAT same class session. Late?**

* Readings questions submitted by the end of the same day will receive partial credit.
* Reading questions submitted later that that will receive no credit unless the student has an excused absence/extension.

## Academic journal articles <span style="color:green">**(JA)**</span>

Most of our readings are published scientific articles from academic journals. The vast majority of these journals cater to scientists in Psychology and related fields. For each journal article, please copy/download and then complete [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mT6H6fQCqaydiYF4awt2YDIXPdRtIvrBP5BRyKYFFZM/edit?usp=sharing) documenting what you took away from the manuscript.

The worksheet is designed to help you work through the essential pieces of information in typical Psychology journal articles.

## Reviews and text book chapters <span style="color:purple">**(RV/BC)**</span>

We may occasionally read a text book chapter or a scientific review, in which case, there is a less standard structure we can base questions around. For these manuscripts, please copy/download and then complete [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lcwO0JyfbTNhpwvRlScTnhBfJfIzfgLL4Zs4dhDYR0E/edit?usp=sharing) documenting what you learned from the reading.
