# Methods in Child Development Research

Winter 2023: CHDV 23150

Tuesdays and Thursdays 2:00pm-3:20pm Chicago time

This course engages with one current topic (the topic differs each year) from research on child social and/or language development. We will read and discuss a collection of research studies related to this topic to gain familiarity with its primary questions, theories, and methods. We will also, together as a class, conduct a replication of an experiment- or recording-based research study related to the topic. Students should be prepared to read and discuss scientific research articles and to do hands-on research activities. Students will complete the class with expertise on the topic of focus, including experience with its associated methods.

**_This year's topic is the role of peers in child linguistic and communicative development._**

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

**Office hours:** Regular hour TBD (Rosenwald Hall 318A or Zoom by request). Also available by appointment.

**Course materials:**

All course materials will be available on ChatterLab course webpage, or otherwise via Canvas.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:

| Component | Percentage |
|-----------|----------------|
| Participation | 20% |
| Paper presentations | 20% |
| Data annotation | 30% |
| Data collection participation | 10% |
| Scientific report | 20% |

### Participation (20% of grade)

Discussion of scientific literature and practice in child development research is the core task of our course. Students are generally expected to come to class and actively participate in discussion. The participation grade reflects the range from all unexcused attendances (0%) to zero unexcused attendances with active participation at every session attended (20%). Students will also be asked to demonstrate evidence of keeping up with the reading via short in-class quizzes; demonstration of having done the reading is taken into account in the participation grade. Please stay in touch with your TA about any limitations you have regarding in-person participation or if you need an excused absence.

### Paper presentations (20% of grade)

Students will take turns presenting a reading on the syllabus, alone or in small groups depending on the size of the class. Each presentation is worth 10% of the grade. Students will be expected to deliver a practice version of their presentation to Dr. Casillas one week in advance of delivering it so that they can incorporate feedback. Incorporation of feedback is taken into account in determining the final grade for each presentation. **A rubric with more specific guidelines will be posted prior to the first presentation assignment.**

### Data annotation (30% of grade)

Students are expected to contribute to the codification of raw data. For example, if the study we decide to replicate is based on an experiment, then you will likely be helping to create stimuli (e.g., choosing pictures or making recordings) and/or learning how to use software to mark down how children respond to the stimuli. As another example, if the study we decide to replicate is based on recordings of children, then you will likely be learning how to use software to mark down when children are using specific linguistic and communicative behaviors; then you will be assigned a portion of big dataset to complete on your own. Together as a class we can accomplish a lot in a short period of time.

**_NOTE: The syllabus is still evolving a little, but we will almost certainly be running an experiment as a class (i.e., we will likely NOT run a recording-based study)._**

You will be graded on the quality of your work according to the specific annotation tasks assigned to you. We will also calculate "reliability" between you and one other classmate, which is a way of saying we will computationally determine how similar the information you generate is to an independent person's information. We'll talk about what reliability scores do and don't tell us in developmental science. **A rubric with more specific guidelines will be posted prior to the first annotation assignment.**

### Data collection participation (10% of grade)

Students in this course will get a sense of what live data collection with children looks like by sitting in on a data collection session with one of the trained research assistants or with the lab manager in Dr. Casillas's lab. Students are required to write up a ~500 (**max** 1500) word report on what they learned from the experience. **A rubric with more specific guidelines will be posted prior to the data collection participation slots open.**

### Scientific report (20% of grade)

Your final assignment will be to submit a scientific report of our class findings (which may perhaps be ongoing) that also proposes and motivates an original, but incremental followup study. We will spend some time learning the basics of scientific report writing and you **will receive a grading rubric for the final paper at that session.**

### Extra credit

You may earn up to 4 percentage points of extra credit by participating in an ongoing experiment in the Chatter Lab (2 points per experiment). If you are interested in participating, contact lab manager Kennedy Casey (chatterlab@uchicago.edu) to schedule an appointment. Kennedy will communicate to me when you have participated in an experiment, but you are welcome to follow up with me to confirm that I have received notice of your extra credit.
