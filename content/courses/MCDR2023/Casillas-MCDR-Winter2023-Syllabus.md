# Methods in Child Development Research

Winter 2023: CHDV 23150, CHST 23150, EDSO 23150/33150, LING 33150, PSYC 23155/33150

Tuesdays and Thursdays 2:00pm-3:20pm Chicago time

This course engages with one current topic (the topic differs each year) from research on child social and/or language development. We will read and discuss a collection of research studies related to this topic to gain familiarity with its primary questions, theories, and methods. We will also, together as a class, conduct a replication of an experiment- or recording-based research study related to the topic. Students should be prepared to read and discuss scientific research articles and to do hands-on research activities. Students will complete the class with expertise on the topic of focus, including experience with its associated methods.

This year's topic is: **_The role of peers in child linguistic and communicative development._**

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (she/her; mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

**Teaching assistant:** Jenny Haizhao Bo (she/her; hbo@uchicago.edu)

**Office hours:** Dr. Casillas only: Thursdays 12:00–2:00pm Rosenwald 318A (Zoom only by request).


**Course materials:**

All course materials will be available via Canvas or this chatterlab course webpage. All readings are posted under "Files" in the canvas course page or are hyperlinked below.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:

| Component | Percentage |
|-----------|----------------|
| Participation | 30% |
| Paper presentations | 20% |
| Stimulus preparation/data annotation | 20% |
| Data collection participation | 10% |
| Final exam | 20% |

### Participation (30% of grade)

Discussion of scientific literature and practice in child development research is the core task of our course. Students are generally expected to come to class and actively participate in discussion. The participation grade reflects the range from all unexcused attendances and no evidence of reading (0%) to zero unexcused attendances with evidence for completion of all readings and active participation at every session attended (30%). Please stay in touch with the TA about any limitations you have regarding in-person participation or if you need an excused absence.

### Paper presentations (20% of grade)

Students will take turns presenting readings, typically in pairs or small groups. Each student's average score over their two presentations will make up 20% of their final grade. Students will be expected to deliver a practice version of their presentation via video recording to Dr. Casillas by 11:59pm on the day of the in-class work session dedicated to that presentation preparation (see below). Dr. Casillas and/or the TA will give feedback within 24 hours. Incorporation of feedback is taken into account in determining the final grade for each presentation. **A rubric with more specific guidelines will be posted prior to the first presentation assignment.**

### Stimulus preparation/data annotation (20% of grade)

This quarter we are replicating an experimental study. Students are expected to actively participate in: (a) the creation and evaluation of stimulus videos for the experiment, (b) testing out the workflow for data collection, and/or (c) testing out the workflow for raw data codification. Each one of these tasks will be led by Dr. Casillas and/or the TA. Students will be assigned specific tasks as they arise and Dr. Casillas and the TA will do their best to distribute tasks equitably. There is no rubric for this portion of the grade because the tasks available are somewhat dynamic and unpredictable---that is the nature of study preparation. Full credit will be given for timely and accurate completion of the assigned tasks.

### Data collection participation (10% of grade)

Students in this course will get a sense of what data collection with children looks like by sitting in on a live data collection session with one of the trained research assistants in the chatterlab, the TA, or with the chatterlab lab manager. Note that given ongoing concerns around COVID-19, data collection will take place online. Students are required to write up a ~500 (**max** 1500) word report on what they learned from the experience. **A rubric with more specific guidelines will be posted prior to the data collection participation slots open.**

### Final exam (20% of grade)

The final exam is take home and will include a mix of medium- and short-length open response questions as well as some data-based questions, all based on topics covered in class. **A grading rubric will be posted prior to the exam deadline.**

### Extra credit

You may earn up to 4 percentage points of extra credit by participating in an ongoing experiment in the chatterlab (2 points per experiment). If you are interested in participating, contact lab manager Kennedy Casey (chatterlab@uchicago.edu) to schedule an appointment. The lab manager will communicate to Dr. Casillas when you have participated in an experiment, but you are welcome to follow up with her to confirm she has received notice of your extra credit.
