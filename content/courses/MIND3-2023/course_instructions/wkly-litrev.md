### Format 2: Literature review increments

Your final paper will build on one or more of the lecture topics we cover this quarter. To ensure that you are ready to write a high quality final paper, we will begin on your literature review in advance of the actual final paper due date.

NOTE: You may choose a topic that we have not covered yet in class. If you do so, you will **first** need to read the papers assigned for that lecture before submitting your literature review components for weeks 7 and 9.

#### Week 7: Topic proposal

* Draft a 2–3 paragraph proposal [max 1500 words] in which you identify (a) the _general_ research question you are interested in, (b) the _specific_ research question you are interested in, (c) which lectures and/or assigned readings your topic relates to, and (d) what _specifically_ you would like to learn further about that topic. If you already are aware of empirical findings or theories that you would like to include in your paper, please mention and cite these as context for your proposal.
* Copy/submit your synopses for the assigned readings on this topic.

**ADVICE:** Pick a topic that is specific and directly related to something we learned about in the assigned readings (not just in lecture). Make sure the topic is thematically linked to the concept of context's influence on psychological functions and processes. If your topic is too broad, you will struggle to create a coherent literature review.

I will give feedback on your proposal, including recommended adjustments to the scope and content of your proposed topic; this may require some back-and-forth correspondence.

#### Week 9: Adding new literature

* Find 3 relevant readings to build your review:
    * Start with your "key" articles (the assigned readings for your topic).
    * Only include journal articles (i.e., do **not** include books or book chapters).
    * Restrict your first-round search to papers that are cited in your key article (i.e., backwards search) or papers that cite your key article (i.e., forwards search).
    * If you are still looking for papers for your review after this first round of looking, repeat the process again with the papers you found by searching forwards/backwards.
    * In other words, all your papers should be interconnected by at least one direct citation from one paper to another, and all should lead back to at least one assigned paper from the course.
    * Ensure that your chosen articles actually address your proposed topic, and do so with enough breadth and depth for you to describe multiple theories and empirical findings.
    * Exclude other class-assigned readings in your search for articles related to your "key" articles

* Submit synopses for the new 3 readings and add to each synopsis how that paper is citation-linked to the key paper.

* Submit a 2–3 paragraph [max 1500 words] summary that briefly describes each study and how the studies interrelate. Do your best to pull out the major puzzle or theory that emerges when considering the studies together. You are encouraged to build on the text you submitted in week 7 insofar as that is useful for your summary.
