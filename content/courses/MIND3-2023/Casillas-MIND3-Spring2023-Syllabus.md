### Self grading

For each assignment and for your participation, I will give you a rubric to self assess your work. You will then be able to give yourself a proposed grade, which I can accept or change. I only plan to change your proposed grade if your proposal is substantially different from what I would give you.

## Participation

In-class time is reserved for clarification, discussion, and self assessment activities. If you have not done the reading for that discussion, you are encouraged to spend the hour making up the reading time on your own rather than attending discussion (seriously!)

You will rate your participation at the end of the quarter.

## Weekly paper

You will complete 7 weekly papers: 5 synopses and 2 increments to a literature review that will become your final paper.

### Synopses 

[Instructions](../course_instructions/wkly-syn/)

Synopses are due in weeks 1–5, 6, and 8. **Synopses are due BEFORE the start of section.**

NOTE: You get a free pass on two synopses. That is, you only need to submit 5 synopses out of the 7 opportunities to do so. You don't need to notify me. I will NOT accept late synopses, but if you're late you can take one of your two free passes.

You will assess the quality of your synopses in class.

### Literature review increments

[Instructions](../course_instructions/wkly-litrev/)

Literature review increments are due in weeks 7 and 9. **Literature reviews are due BEFORE the start of section.**

NOTE: You can NOT apply a free "pass" to a literature review assignment.

You will assess the quality of your and your peers' literature review increments in class.
