NOTES FOR NEXT TIME:

# issues w/ DM portion of experiment
- needed app to record (i.e., not on phone)
- had another thing too soon after -- can't minimize screen
- one participant needed to use phone
- rescheduling link changed the link and that meant re-sending so caused a time panic
- laptop dying/zoom crashing
- can't see participants in recording
- someone lost wifi for 20 sec
- use official uchicago Zoom account; some didn't infer this
- ... and from myself; i'm still worried somehow they are sharing videos
- ... and from myself; take two full lectures to go through instructions


MA3: Go over producer vs. signal meaning in more depth



# more on what made annotation difficult after MD
what isn't obvious in annotation?
talk that is not on task
interleaving of talk about cards
multiple card references in one utterance
simultaneous completion points
version control in submitted versions
access to lab computers
... also weird DM recordings e.g., cut-outs and re-starts making need for media re-cutting/special re-alignment of annotations for OH


Info to add to the results that were presented in class
- remainder of student data
- common names for different images
- how often people change their placements
- how often the overhearers are leaving things blank
- if people are related vs. not affect accuracy (not this year)

# Human language and interaction

Spring 2023: CHDV 23100, LING 21150, PSYC 23120, EDSO 23101

Tuesdays and Thursdays 9:30am-10:50am Chicago time

Language may be learned by individuals, but we most often use it for communication between groups. How is it that we manage to transmit our internal thoughts to others' minds? How is it that we can understand what others mean to express to us? Whether we are greeting a passerby, ordering a meal, or debating politics, there are a number of invisible processes that bring language to life in the space between individuals. This course investigates the social and cognitive processes that enable us to successfully communicate with others. The theories we cover are built on observations of adult language use and child development in multiple cultural settings, taking inspiration also from non-human animal communication.

It is expected that, by the end of the course, students will be able to explain the limitations of language for communication and will be able to elaborate on a number of social and other cognitive processes that critically support communicative language use.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:


| Component | Undergraduates |
|-----------|----------------|
| Mini papers | 45% |
| Participation | 10% |
| Scientific report | 45% |


### Mini papers (45% of grade)

Over the course of the quarter, students will submit three mini papers (up to 15% each; 2500 words max). Mini papers typically engage with real data of some kind. Papers will be evaluated based on their (a) thoroughness and attention to detail with respect to the data/prompt, and (b) quality of discussion relating the data to course materials. We strongly discourage students from centering their responses on personal anecdotes or pure critique. Responses should instead make specific, clear connections to relevant course concepts, and critical commentary should be accompanied by integrative and/or constructive framing.

Note: There are four opportunities to submit mini papers—students can choose which three they would like to submit (students may NOT submit a fourth paper for extra credit or for a 'redo' of a previous paper).

### Participation (10% of grade)

Students are generally expected to come to class and actively participate in discussion. The participation grade reflects the range from no attendance (0%) to near-full attendance and active participation at every session attended (10%). Please stay in touch with your TA about any limitations you have regarding in-person participation.

### Scientific report (45% of grade)

We will replicate some of the classic findings reported in [Schober & Clark's (1989)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nlhgqs61wv387dv/SchoberClark1989.pdf?dl=0) paper. Your final assignment will be to submit a scientific report of our class findings that also proposes and motivates an original, but incremental followup study. This scientific report will depend on several components whose deadlines are over the quarter as follows:

1. Read and review the original paper (in class, led by Dr. Casillas)
2. Data collection and annotation: matchers and directors (15% of grade)
3. Data collection and annotation: overhearers (5% of grade)
6. Review of results (in class, led by Dr. Casillas)
7. Scientific report (due Tuesday of finals week, 4000 words *max*; 25% of grade)

We will spend some time on learning the basics of scientific report writing.

### Extra credit

You may earn up to 2 points of extra credit by participating in an ongoing experiment in the Chatter Lab. If you are interested in participating, contact lab manager Kennedy Casey (chatterlab@uchicago.edu) to schedule an appointment.
