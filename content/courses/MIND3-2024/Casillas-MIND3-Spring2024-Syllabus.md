## Participation

We use in-class time for clarification, discussion, and debate. If you have not done the reading for that discussion, you are encouraged to spend the hour making up the reading time on your own rather than attending discussion (seriously; just send me an email to let me know). You'll have a chance to weigh in on your own participation grade.

For full participation credit, you must complete:

* A critical reflection for your writing advisor (completed in class)
* The week 5 writing workshop (completed in class)
* A 1-on-1 meeting with your writing advisor (schedule yourself: Danny Jacobs, dwjacobs@uchicago.edu) **DUE by end of day on Friday, May 17th, 2024**


## Weekly assignments

The weekly assignments include: 3â€“4 paper synopses, 2 debate preparations, and 2 phases of a literature review to get your final paper started.  **ALL assignments are due _BEFORE_ the start of section.**
