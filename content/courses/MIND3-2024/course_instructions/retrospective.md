### Retrospective

Please send me, as a Word document, Google document, or pdf:

* 1â€“2 paragraphs introducing yourself and any information you'd like me to know about you
* 1 paragraph each that describes the three Mind I/II lectures that have most impacted you and why (so, 3 paragraphs total). Remember that I wasn't there, so please provide detail on content where relevant.
* 1 question for me (about whatever you like)
