## Assignment descriptions

### Question and synopsis

Post to Canvas discussion board (**in this order**):

1. A succinctly stated **question** directly derived from the week’s readings and lecture (two-three sentences at most). This should be a question that emerges from having understood the claims presented in the readings and/or lecture, not just a general question that one could ask of the topic without having read the material or heard the lecture.
2. A **synopsis** of one of the readings (see directions for week 1 here and the other weeks here)

### 1-question comprehension quiz

I will pick one quick question from the readings for that week that you should be able to answer if you have read the papers. The quiz is given at the start of our Thursday section hour.

## Final deadline (Tuesday, 31 May 2022)
More information TBA
