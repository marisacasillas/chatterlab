# Week 1 synopsis
After reading and analyzing each of this week’s assigned articles by applying the methods outlined in the handout Guidelines for Mind (see `Files/Guidelines for Mind (HenlyFallQ).pdf` on Canvas), write a synopsis of one of them. Your synopsis should succinctly address the following questions (you should be able to answer most of these questions using 1 sentence or even bullet points, #4 and #5 may take a little more explanation). 

Your synopsis should include the following:

1.	**The phenomenon:** Identify the scientific issue. What is the BIG, “why-do-we-care” question the authors want to understand? (e.g., in Li et al. (2014): What factors influence how we distribute resources? Given that we value equality, why do our actions often perpetuate inequality?)
2.	**Specific question:**  What aspect of that BIG issue do the authors seek to address? (Often this is about how they position their question in relation to prior research or theory. For example: How are children’s preferences for and treatment of other people influenced by the resources those others have?)
3.	**Experimental hypothesis:**  What is the concrete hypothesis they are testing in this study? (e.g., Children will redress inequality but only when it is obvious. Otherwise, they will favor people who are already advantaged.)
4.	**How do they test this hypothesis? (Method):** Explain the logic of the basic design and how it is implemented. Only describe those features of the design that are essential to understanding the relevant aspects of how the study tests the hypothesis. 
5.	**What is the pattern of results reported? (Results):** Summarize the results so that their relevance to the question is apparent.
6.	**Implications for hypotheses (Discussion):** What do the authors conclude this pattern of results indicates about their experimental hypotheses and the specific question of interest?
