# Crosslinguistic perspectives on language development

**Quarter:** Fall 2023

**Class:** Wednesdays 1:30pm-4:20pm

**Office hours:** Book online [here](https://calendar.app.google/fkdDh37gZbpBQsNx6) in Rosenwald 318A or Zoom (please indicate in your online booking)

**Instructor:** Marisa Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

This discussion-based course covers cross-linguistic evidence concerning similarities and dissimilarities in how children learn language across diverse language communities. Each year will revolve around a central topic. This year we will focus on the acquisition of phonology. Assignments are noted in <span style="color:green">green text</span>.

## Grading 

* 70% participation
* 30% final presentation

## Participation

This class is a seminar, which means all of our in-class time is dedicated to group discussion of papers that we have read. Everyone is expected to both (1) do the weekly readings and (2) contribute to the group discussions. As part of participation, students will:

* take turns presenting papers to the class and leading discussion, and
* help each other refine ideas in the presentation workshops.

## Final presentation

During the last 1–2 days of class (depending on class size), students will give a brief presentation about a research question and proposed study design related to the course topic/readings. The best presentations will be well embedded in current theory, detailed in the report of their design, grounded in some real data (e.g., pilot data, original indirect supporting evidence, etc.), and have a concrete analysis plan that aligns with principles of open science.
