# Blooming, Buzzing Confusion
## Making Sense of Language in the First Few Years of Life

Winter 2023: CHDV 23010

Tuesdays and Thursdays 3:30pm-4:50pm

This course examines the social and cognitive mechanisms that drive language learning in the first few years of life. Nearly all children learn the language(s) of their community, despite the fact that human languages and caregiving practices offer immense diversity around the globe. What enables the learning system to adapt so robustly to the environment it finds itself in? We discuss the evidence for and against multiple factors that have been proposed to support language development across the world’s communities. We also critically examine how these ideas intersect with current deficit models of language learning. 
It is expected that, by the end of the course, students will grasp the basic mechanisms proposed to underlie early language learning and will design a novel research project to test one of these mechanisms in infants or young children.

# Grading

Students enrolled in this course will be graded on the following basis:


| Component | Undergraduates |
|-----------|----------------|
| [Reading questions](./course-instructions/reading_notes.md) | 40% |
| [Participation](./course-instructions/participation.md) | 20% |
| [Mini essay exams](./course-instructions/mini_essay_exams.md) | 30% |
| [Methods presentations](https://marisacasillas.github.io/chatterlab/course-instructions/methods_presentations) | 10% |


### Reading questions

For each reading, students are expected to demonstrate their understanding by responding to a handful of questions. There are three types of readings: journal articles, scientific reviews, and book chapters. For journal articles (indicated below with <span style="color:green">**(JA)**</span>), students should copy/download and then complete the notes worksheet [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mT6H6fQCqaydiYF4awt2YDIXPdRtIvrBP5BRyKYFFZM/edit?usp=sharing). For scientific reviews and book chapters (indicated below with <span style="color:purple">**(RV)**</span> or <span style="color:purple">**(BC)**</span>), the students should copy/download and then complete the notes worksheet [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lcwO0JyfbTNhpwvRlScTnhBfJfIzfgLL4Zs4dhDYR0E/edit?usp=sharing). A full-credit worksheet is complete, thoughtfully written, and has minimal direct quotation from the readings.

### Participation

For participation credit, students are expected to come to class and [actively participate](./course-instructions/participation.md) in discussion unless they have an excused absence. In the case of an excused absence, please email Dr. Casillas (mcasillas@uchicago.edu)

### Mini essay exams

Students are expected to complete three mini essay exams: one in week 4, one in week 7, and one during finals week. For each exam, students will have one week to give two short (~500 word) responses to take-home prompts. The exam will be graded following the instructions [here](./course-instructions/mini_essay_exams.md).

### Methods presentations

Each student is expected to participate in one methods presentation. Methods presentations are group projects. Each group will interview a researcher with expertise in the assigned method and then: (1) create a 20-minute pre-recorded mini lecture introducing and giving some demonstration of the assigned research method and (2) elicit and answer questions from the class (~10-15 minutes). Group members will also give a short evaluation of their and their peers' contributions to the project (see the [guidelines](./course-instructions/methods_presentations.md) for details).
