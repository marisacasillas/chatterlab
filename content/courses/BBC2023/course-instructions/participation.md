# Participation as _active attendance_

I will ask myself the following questions after each class session. If the answers are 'yes' to at least two of the three, the student will receive full credit for participation that session. Otherwise the student will receive receive no credit for the session.

1. Did the student attend?
2. Did the student ask one or more questions or comments?
3. Did the student respond to questions from others or substantially contribute to group activities?

Note that students with an excused absence for a class session will simply receive full credit for that session.
