# Grading guidelines: Mini essay exams

Three times throughout the quarter, students will be expected to complete a mini essay exam. Each mini essay exam requires students to give ~500 word responses to two prompts. The exams are take-home and open-book; students have one week to complete each exam. Each exam is worth a total of 10 points (10% of the total grade) as follows:

**Mini essay exam 1:**

* Response 1 (5 points max)

* Response 2 (5 points max)

**Mini essay exam 2:**

* Response 1 (5 points max)

* Response 2 (5 points max)

**Mini essay exam 3:**

* Response 1 (5 points max)

* Response 2 (5 points max)
