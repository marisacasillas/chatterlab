# Grading guidelines: Methods presentations

Each student is expected to participate in one methods presentation. Students earn up to 10 points (10% of the total grade) for their presentation project.

This is a groupwork project, but group members will have an opportunity to report on individual contributions. There are three primary components to each presentation:

1. Give a 20-minute **pre-recorded** mini lecture that introduces a method and gives some sort of demonstration of how the method is implemented and how it appears to participants.
2. Elicit and answer questions from the class about the method (~10-15 minutes). You are encouraged to use creative techniques to stimulate discussion.
3. Fill out a peer evaluation form for yourself and your group members.

In preparing the presentation, each group will be asked to inteview one researcher who has expertise in that method. The interview will be 20â€“30 minutes long and conducted in person or over Zoom. Interview scheduling will be coordinated by Dr. Casillas *BUT* your group must provide draft questions and potential interview times **ONE WEEK** (or earlier) in advance of your presentation.

In the presentation, each group must provide slides with some media files (photo, video, audio) to support their demonstration, and should additionally provide some kind of explanation of how the analysis is done following data collection. Check out the FAQs below for more info!

Dr. Casillas will assign students to methods topics at the start of the quarter. Deadlines for each methods presentation are pre-set for the quarter and will be established on the first day of lecture. **Students joining after the first day must contact Dr. Casillas to join a group.**


## Expectations for full credit

In order to earn full credit, all of the following must hold:

* The student contributed one question toward the interview with the expert researcher
* The student created at least one content slide in the mini lecture
* The student presented at least one content slide in the mini lecture
* The student's contribution to the presentation included introducing and/or explaining an important concept for the method
* The student did something to facilitate discussion or to answer questions during the live question round
* The student completed the peer evaluation form
* The student was evaluated by their group members as having made a substantial contribution


## FAQs

**What do you recommend the timeline to be for this presentation?**

_You should contact your group members immediately to coordinate. **You must submit your group's available times for an interview and your draft questions at least one week in advance of your presentation deadline.** Dr. Casillas will help coordinate the interview appointment. Once you have completed the interview, you should meet with your gorup again to discuss what your presentation will look like and who will work on which slides, etc. You may need to meet again to record or practice the presentation before class time._

**In order to have a media file for the presentation, should we ask the expert for one from one of their own studies or is that something we should find ourselves? I think I found an example already, so should I just use that one?**

_If you've already found an example media file (or media files) I advise you to check it with the expert and ask them if they have anything better you can use in your presentation. The expert might have some interesting things to point out that aren't in the examples you find independently. It would be even better if you sent the expert whatever example files you have in advance so that they can view it and provide alternatives if they have them._

**Should we record the interviews with the experts?**

_You can record the interview with the expert's permission. But you'll have to ask them explicitly. You will also need to be clear about where you'll store the recording, when you'll delete it, and what you will use it for._
