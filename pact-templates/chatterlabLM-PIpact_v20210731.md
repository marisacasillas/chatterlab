# Chatter lab Lab manager-PI pact

The purpose of this document is to establish guidelines that will help you, the lab manager, understand what to anticipate when it comes to work responsibilities and research opportunities in the lab.

## Your duties

* The scope of your work duties includes:
    * Managing existing audio-, image-, and text-based datasets:
        * Setting up and applying open-source tools to the data
        * Contributing to new tool development for annotation/analysis
        * Documenting data treatments and protocols for annotation/analysis
        * Leading metadata and directory structure organization and archival
    * Facilitating human subjects data collection and processing:
        * Training new lab members on rules and systems for participant recruitment and running behavioral studies in the lab
        * Setting up robust data archival and lab equipment tracking systems
        * Managing research assistants who are working on manual data annotation or data collection
        * Aiding lab members in experiment programming and automated stimulus creation
    * Contributing to manuscript preparation:
        * Aiding lab members in getting their data, code, and manuscripts on GitHub
        * Fixing formatting errors and generating bibliographies in manuscripts
    * Leading lab events:
        * Organizing routine meetings, e.g., weekly lab meetings and quarterly check-ins
        * Co-organizing public-facing lab events, e.g., museum research demonstrations
        * Helping run other special events, e.g., international workshops hosted by the lab, visits to the lab by distant collaborators, etc.
    * Maintaining the lab website
    * Leading and working on your own research/learning projects in the lab, as agreed with Dr. Casillas
    * Other ad hoc duties, as you are willing (e.g., equipment purchases, RA hiring, RA enrichment activities, etc.)
* Maintain a strategic plan documenting your assigned work and research tasks as well as your intended dates for working on them
    * Your plan must have both a long-term goals section and a weekly plan section
    * Maintaining means:
        * 1 x per year: Thorough listing and assessment of long-term goals
        * 1 x per quarter: Draft weekly plan for the quarter with SMART(-ish) goals
        * 1 x per week: Update weekly plan for the upcoming week
        * Daily: Adjust weekly plan as needed
* Unless you are on vacation, meet at least once weekly with Dr. Casillas. At these meetings you should always be prepared as follows:
    * Update your strategic plan before the meeting and be ready to go through the current week together
    * Open a document where you can keep notes during the meeting
        * Before the meeting, add a summary or pointer(s) to notes about any doubts and decisions that you need to discuss
        * During the meeting, take notes of all decisions, to-dos, reminders, advice, and remaining questions
        * Immediately integrate notes from the meeting into your strategic plan and/or elsewhere, as appropriate
    * Be prepared to lead discussion about your weekly progress and any issues that have arisen in completing your tasks
    * The typical meeting agenda should be:
        * Review of administrative task progress
        * Review of annotation/data collection work progress (including summaries of RA progress)
        * Mentoring discussion on lab manager's own research work
* Plan and lead weekly meetings with:
    * Each RA, to check in on their individual task progress (this can be done over Slackâ€”they should respond within 48 hours)
    * Each ongoing project team in which you are involved (e.g., as an RA manager, an annotator/data collector, an investigator, etc.)
    * As in your meetings with Dr. Casillas, be prepared to lead these meetings, take notes of all decisions, to-dos, reminders, advice, and remaining questions, and document these for the longer term as needed (e.g., in your strategic plan, in documents you share with the project team, etc.)
    * Be prepared to report on these meetings in your weekly meeting w/ Dr. Casillas.
* Meet at least once per quarter with Dr. Casillas to discuss:
    * Your broader goals and experiences in the lab
    * Evaluations of your (and my!) performance (including this pact)
    * What intellectual contributions you have made and your authorship status relative to those projects
    * Your strategic plan and (any needed updates to it)
* Attend regular lab meetings, unless you've otherwise cleared your absence with Dr. Casillas.
    * Present at least once per quarter at lab meeting (project presentation, reading group, or other)
    * You are strongly encouraged, but not required, to actively participate in these meetings by responding to and asking questions, adding your thoughts to discussion, suggesting papers to read/visitors to invite, and so on.
* Concentrate your work during standard weekdays working hours (9am to 5pm) to help you better coordinate tasks among lab members as needed.
* Respond helpfully and promptly to all lab-related communications addressed directly to you unless you are on leave.
    * On weekdays, "prompt" responses means: responses to Slack within 2 hours and responses to email within 24 hours
    * You are not expected to respond promptly toward the end of the workday or on the weekends or on holidays!
* Strictly adhere to lab protocol for maintaining participant privacy.
    * This includes minimizing local copies of data on your personal laptop, if relevant
* Update records of your work hours and your contributions after each work day in the relevant documents.
* Always ask questions if something is not clear, whether it's an annotation task, something that happened during participant testing, or something else.
    * Ask your questions as soon as possible, particularly regarding interactions with participants visiting the lab for research tasks.
    * Do not assume an answer; pause until you have received an adequate answer.
* Treat all members and visitors of the lab with respect.
    * Take advantage of the fact that this is a lab in which many different experiences, perspectives, and ways of thinking will be brought to the table.
* If you witness inappropriate behavior, please promptly report it to Dr. Casillas.
    * Your anonymity will be preserved.
* If you are facing significant interruptions to your work for any reason, be prompt and honest in bringing these to Dr. Casillas's attention so we can adapt accordingly.
* You understand that extension of your work contract in the lab is contingent upon mutual satisfaction with your previous work experience with Dr. Casillas in the two quarters preceding the end of your contract.

## Your rights

* You may request a meeting with Dr. Casillas at any point to discuss issues with your tasks and goals
* You may work out a semi-flexible version of your schedule with your supervisor when needed, but this should be short-term and exceptional.
* You should have significant time to work on research/learning project of your choosing every week, with the goal of making significant progress on at least one large project per year (e.g., on a new experiment, on paper submission, etc.), ideally two or more.
* You should discuss your professional goals for your time after you leave the lab with Dr. Casillas and, in return, be given some training and opportunities for development and networking that will help you after you leave.
* You cannot be asked to work on a project that, for whatever reasons, makes you feel uncomfortable. If you realize this is the case, please raise the issue as soon as possible with Dr. Casillas.
* If it is determined that you have made intellectual contributions to a project, you have the right to request authorship on presentation and/or publication of the results. Though note that this comes with additional responsibilities as well. The particular additional responsibilities will need to be worked out with Dr. Casillas and the research leader for that project.
* You have the right to participate in all lab-wide events and to inquire about participation on new projects.
* You have the right to suggest new research projects for consideration by Dr. Casillas; any acceptance of your suggestion should be followed promptly by a meeting discussing your rights and responsibilities as a co-author.
* You may request a reference letter from Dr. Casillas after at least 2 months of working in the lab. Though before you do so you should discuss whether this is a good strategy in a one-on-one meeting with Dr. Casillas.
* Dr. Casillas should respond to your lab-relevant communications promptly unless she's on leave:
    * On weekdays, "prompt" responses means: responses to Slack within 2 hours and responses to email within 24 hours
    * Excepting: messages sent toward the end of the workday or on the weekends or on holidays
