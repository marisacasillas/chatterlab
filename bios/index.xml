I received my BA from Cornell University, where I studied Linguistics and Psychology with a minor in Cognitive Science. As an undergrad I worked with Professor Michael Goldstein and was involved in multiple research projects exploring early language learning in social contexts. Broadly, I am interested in language acquisition and development in social contexts, and in cross-linguistic and cross-cultural comparison.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/jordyn-aboutme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/jordyn-aboutme/</guid><description>Jordyn Martin (she/her/hers) About me I joined the Chatter Lab in January of 2023.

I joined the chatter lab in summer 2021 after completing my BA degree at Princeton University, where I concentrated in Psychology and also studied Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Neuroscience. During undergrad, I worked primarily with Dr. Casey Lew-Williams, and my thesis research combined eye-tracking and corpus-based observational methods to investigate how infants learn and represent some of their earliest words.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/lizzie-aboutme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/lizzie-aboutme/</guid><description>Lizzie Mickiewicz (she/her/hers) About me I am a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in neuroscience and psychology at the University of Chicago. I am interested in exploring the influence of cognitive processes on language and vice versa, with a focus on incorporating both naturalistic and experimental measures in my work.
Currently, I am working on my senior thesis project, studying whether the phenomenon of infant phoneme discrimination can accurately be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/marisa-aboutme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/marisa-aboutme/</guid><description>Principal investigator Dr. Marisa Casillas Photo credit: Erielle Bakkum
About Broadly speaking, I am interested in exploring how cognitive and social processes shape the ways in which we learn, perceive, and produce language. My primary research examines the relationship between communicative skills and linguistic processing in children and adults. I use a combination of experimental- and observation-based methods to comparatively investigate these processes in both urban, Western contexts and rural, Indigenous contexts.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/ruby-aboutme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/ruby-aboutme/</guid><description>Ruby Swensen Hi! My name is Ruby Swensen. I am in my second year as an undergraduate student studying linguistics with an emphasis in American Sign Language and a special interest in comparative human development. I joined the Chatter Lab in January 2023 excited to learn more about the many applications of language on human interaction and behavior. When I’m not studying or working in the lab, I love to go ice skating on the midway!</description></item><item><title/><link>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/sarah-aboutme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/bios/sarah-aboutme/</guid><description>Sarah Sommer (she/her/hers) About me I am a fourth year undergrad double majoring in Comparative Human Development and English at the University of Chicago.

During undergrad, I worked primarily with Dr. Delphine Dahan to study how we interpret questions in conversation. My primary research interests are in the intersections of psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, and language acquisition, with a focus on natural conversation.
