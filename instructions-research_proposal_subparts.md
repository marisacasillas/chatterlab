# Grading guidelines: Research proposal sub-part submissions

A significant component of this course is the development of a proposal for research. In order to prevent last-minute preparation of this time-consuming individual task, drafts for three subsections of the proposal will be due in advance of the final deadline (1 point each), as follows:

## Outline of the proposal
For full credit (1 point), students should submit an outline containing the following sections with a list of bulleted sub-topcs beneath each one:

1. Literature review
2. Research question
3. Predictions
4. Methods
5. Analysis
6. "If so..." discussion
7. "If not..." discussion
8. References cited

## Study design
For full credit (1 point), students should submit a complete (okay if it's rough) draft of the following sections mentioned above. Complete means full sentences—no more bullet points:

2. Research question
3. Predictions
4. Methods
5. Analysis

## Literature review
For full credit (1 point), students should submit a complete (okay if it's rough) draft of the following sections mentioned above. Complete means full sentences—no more bullet points:

8. References cited

Students may also optionally submit their "If so..."/"If not..." drafts for comment if those are already drafted.
